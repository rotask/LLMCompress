Usually, he would be tearing around the living room, playing with his toys.but just one look at a minion sent him practically catatonic.that had been megan's plan when she got him dressed earlier.he'd seen the movie almost by mistake, considering he was a little young for the pg cartoon, but with older cousins, along with her brothers, mason was often exposed to things that were older.she liked to think being surrounded by adults and older kids was one reason why he was a such a good talker for his age."aren't you being a good boy?"she said.mason barely acknowledged her.instead, his baby blues remained focused on the television.since the movie was almost over, megan knew she better slip into the bedroom and finish getting ready.each time she looked into mason's face, she was grateful that he looked nothing like his father.his platinum blond hair and blue eyes were completely hers.it was only his build that he was taking after his father.where megan was a diminutive 5'3", davis was 6'1" and two hundred pounds.mason was already registering off the charts in height and weight according to his pediatrician.davis had seen mason only twice in his lifetime-the day he had been born and the day he came home from the hospital.after that, he hadn't been interested in any of the pictures and emails megan sent.with his professional football career on the rise, davis hadn't wanted to be shackled with the responsibilities of a baby.instead, he wanted to spend his time off the field partying until all hours of the night.he only paid child support when megan threatened to have his wages garnished.she dreaded the day when mason was old enough to ask about his father.she never wanted anything in the world to hurt him, and she knew that being rejected by his father would.with a sigh, she stepped into the dress and slid it over her hips.wrestling around to get the zipper all the way up caused her to huff and puff.standing back from the mirror, she turned to and fro to take in her appearance.she'd always loved how the dress made her feel sexy, but at the same time was very respectable.while it boasted a sweetheart neckline, the hemline fell just below her knees.she put on her pearls-a high school graduation gift from her uncle aidan, or "ankle", as she often called him.aidan was her mother's baby brother and only son of the family.when she was born, he was only eight and a half.as the first grandchild, megan spent a lot of time with her grandparents, and that in turn, meant she spent a lot of time with aidan.he had devoted hours to holding her and spoiling her rotten.when it came time for her to talk, she just couldn't seem to get "uncle aidan" out.instead, she called him "ankle."it was a nickname that had stuck with him even now that he was thirty-four and married.while it had been no question that she wanted him as godfather for mason, she had been extremely honored when he and his wife, emma, had asked her to be their son, noah's, godmother.she loved her newest cousin very much and planned to be the best godmother she could for him.as she stepped out of the bedroom, she found that mason had yet to move."okay buddy, time to go."when he started to whine, she shook her head."we have such a fun day ahead of us.it's noah's baptism, and then there's a party at uncle aidan and aunt emma's house.""beau?"he asked.she laughed."yes, you'll get to see and play with beau, too."as she went to the couch and picked him up, she couldn't help finding it amusing that out of everyone he was going to see today, he was most excited about being with aidan and emma's black lab, beau.one day when they had their own place again, she would get him a dog.he loved them too much to be denied."oomph," she muttered, as they started up the basement stairs."heawy?"he asked."yes, you're getting to be such a big, heavy boy."when they made it to the kitchen, megan paused to catch her breath.she only had a second before her mother breezed in with sean, and her youngest brother, gavin."ready?"she asked.megan nodded.feeling like she was once again a teenager, she filed behind her parents as they headed into the garage."i want to drive," gavin said.with a smirk, sean replied, "like i'm gon na let you drive my car."he then slid into the driver's seat as gavin reluctantly walked around to the passenger's side."we'll see you there in just a few," her mother called.sean acknowledged her with a two finger salute before cranking up and pulling down the driveway.megan worked to get mason into the car seat in her parents' land rover.once he was safely strapped and buckled in, she hopped in beside him.her parents rattled along to each other as they made their way through the tree-lined suburbs where megan had grown up.while some might look on her as having a mark against her character being an unwed mother, she had lived a relatively non-rebellious life.even though she'd been a cheerleader and ran with the popular crowd in school, she rarely partied to excess.instead, she had focused on getting good grades.at that time, she had her heart set on going to medical school and becoming a doctor.from the time she was a little girl, she had wanted nothing more than to help people.she was always mending birds with broken wings or trying to resuscitate squirrels who had been hit by cars.she ditched playing princess for playing "hospital."her desire to become a doctor was why she needed the best scores and best activities and why she generally shunned any temptations to lead her off the right path.she had even managed to bypass the usual freshman craziness when she went off to the university of georgia.it wasn't until she fell in love for the first time in her life that she threw everything away.sadly, she couldn't say that her first love was davis, mason's father.instead, it was another football player, this time a running back at uga, who captured and later broke her heart a year later.carsyn ran with the fast crowd, and when she was with him, she partied and drank too much.he was controlling and possessive, and he wanted all of her time.when she was with him, she had little time for studying.with her grades already in the toilet, she was unprepared for the emotional breakdown she experienced when carsyn broke up with her.devastated, she stopped going to class and ended up flunking the semester.by the time she got back on track with her grades, she had abandoned any hope of medical school.instead, she decided that she would become a nurse, which would fulfill her need to care for sick people.of course, her relationship with davis ended up derailing shortly before graduation when she got pregnant unexpectedly.she had to take several semesters off after mason was born.she was a few years off from when she had originally planned on graduating, but she was excited after everything had that had happened, she was finally finishing.her mother's voice brought megan out of her thoughts."here we are," she said pleasantly.leaning forward in her seat, megan eyed the clock on the dashboard.she wasn't surprised to see they had arrived half an hour before the baptism started.one thing her mother prided herself on was being on time and lending a hand.as they started into the church, her mother reached for mason."we'll take him so you can go see if emma needs any help."megan bent over to kiss mason's cheek."see you in a little while, sweetie."he grinned and then happily dodged her mother's arms for her father's instead, which made megan smile.he was such a man's man already.he loved sitting between her brothers on the couch and watching tv.while it was good that he had so many male role models, she only hoped he hadn't inherited too much of his father's personality.after megan watched them disappear in the crowd of family and friends waiting in the church alcove, she bypassed everyone by turning right and heading down the hallway.at the last door on the right, she knocked."it's me, megan."emma's best friend, casey, answered the door."well, if it isn't the fairy godmother," she mused with a grin.after megan stepped inside, casey threw her arms around her.megan had only met her a few times, but it was hard not liking emma's vivacious and outgoing friend.casey's long brown hair was pulled back in a lose knot, and she wore a demure black slip dress and heels."so how's it going?"megan asked, gazing from noah's diapered but na**d form to emma.she was feeding him a bottle while her upper body was draped in a towel.peeking out from the covering, she saw emma was wearing her signature color, green.as noah sucked on his bottle, he twirled a strand of emma's auburn hair between his fingers.both father and son were fans of emma wearing her hair down.emma grinned."good, i guess.i mean, i don't have a lot of experience with baptisms."megan laughed and motioned to the towel and noah."it looks like you're taking all the proper precautions-nothing like spit-up on your dress or his."with a nod, emma replied, "tell me about it.especially since his gown is so old."megan eyed the lacy baptismal gown hanging on the closet door.she recognized it from pictures of ankle's baptism.he had worn it, and now it was being passed down to his son.casey snorted."i'm sure aidan wouldn't appreciate you alluding to the fact his gown is an antique, thus in turn saying he's old."emma laughed."no, i'm sure he wouldn't.of course, he'd probably argue that while the gown might not have held up, he still looks fabulous and much younger than his age."megan smiled."that sounds just like him."she bent over emma to rub one of noah's hands.he grabbed her thumb in his fist and held on for dear life."aw, you love your godmother, don't you noah?"emma asked.noah momentarily stopped sucking on the bottle to flash a quick smile, which warmed megan's heart."he's such a sweet boy," she mused."and a charmer, just like his old man," casey mused."that too," megan agreed.thinking about her position, she cocked her head at casey."are you sure you're fine with me being the godmother?"casey waved her hand dismissively."honey, the last thing i need is the responsibility.i plan on spoiling noah rotten and corrupting him as only a good auntie can do!"emma rolled her eyes."i'm very satisfied with both my choices, megan.you don't have to worry.""so who is the godfather again?i know he's not part of the family."casey gasped as her hand flew to her chest dramatically."you mean, you've never met dr. mcdreamy bollywood?"megan shrugged."no, i haven't.i mean, i've heard about him and how he flew aidan home in time for noah's birth."she noticed the pleading look that emma exchanged with casey."why?what should i know about him?"casey tapped her chin with her index finger."hmm, what should you know about the good godfather?"she winked at megan."first off, he is seriously delectable.i mean, the man is like sex on a stick.tall, jet-black hair, dark eyes, and he's built like a brick shithouse."megan suddenly felt her interest piquing.she hadn't imagined that the godfather would be good-looking.it had been such a long time since she had dated anyone.scratch that-it had been a long time since she'd had sex with anyone.she'd spent the last two years completely dateless since she and davis broke up.she could practically join one of the local parishes as a nun with how long she had abstained."really?""mmm, hmm.he reminds me of that bollywood actor john abraham," casey said.emma snorted."since when do you watch bollywood movies?""since one of nate's friends asked us to an indian film festival."casey grinned at megan."besides the fact that he's a serious looker, he's also kind, compassionate, and caring-an overall wonderful man.""really now?"megan questioned."and he's loaded because he's a doctor."this man was sounding better and better by the minute."is he single?"emma made a strangled noise before casey replied, "oh, yeah, he's single.he's a widower actually."megan pursed her lips at the prospect.widowers usually fell into two categories-those who were still devastated by their wives' deaths or those who were ready to have fun and live a little.she certainly hoped this pesh guy fell into the second category.more than anything, she wanted to have a little fun herself."do you really think you might be interested in dating pesh?"emma asked, as she moved noah to her shoulder to burp him.with a shrug, megan replied, "dating him or just having some fun with him.sounds like he could use some."emma grimaced as she wiped noah's face off."this is exactly why i told aidan not to try and fix you two up.""what do you mean?""pesh needs a relationship, not a hook-up after all he's been through.besides his wife's death, he hasn't had it easy on the dating front.""what happened?"when casey snorted, emma shot her a death glare."nothing.it's just he doesn't need to get involved with someone who isn't interested in a long-term relationship.""em, you might as well tell her," casey urged.megan glanced between the two of them."tell me what?""fine," emma huffed resignedly.she handed noah to casey."make yourself useful by changing his diaper."as casey got busy cleaning up noah, emma turned to megan."when aidan and i broke up-" "what you meant to say is, after you left aidan when he didn't show up for noah's gender ultrasound because he was cheating on you?"casey interrupted, waving around the wet wipe in her hand.emma closed her eyes for a moment before shaking her head."yes, that's right.thank you so very much for bringing up that aspect of our break-up on today of all days."casey gripped noah's ankles and hoisted up his little butt to slide on the new diaper."you're welcome.""anyway, as you were saying," megan pressed."right.so it was when aidan and i were broken up that i met pesh.i was with your papa fitzgerald the day of his heart attack at the vfw, and pesh was the doctor who treated him.""so... you both struck up a friendship then?"megan asked.emma grimaced."not exactly.you see, patrick wanted to force aidan to really fight for me, and he felt the best way to do it would be for him to have some competition."megan felt her eyes widening in surprise."papa wanted pesh to date you?""yeah.""did you?"emma was momentarily distracted by casey blowing raspberries on noah's stomach.a smile spread across her face as noah kicked his legs and giggled at casey."want me to get him in his dress?"casey asked, as she glanced up."if you don't mind."bringing her hand to her hip, megan huffed out an exasperated breath."um, could you please focus for just a minute considering the bomb you just dropped on me?""i'm sorry.i didn't want to tell you at all.i mean, whatever was between us is all in the past.neither one of us really cared for each other like we thought we did.""did you..." megan said.at emma's confused expression, she wiggled her eyebrows suggestively.emma's face flushed."no, of course not!"casey eyed emma as she took the baptism gown off the hanger."you did make out with him though.""one time.and he certainly didn't get to second base," emma argued.with a wicked grin, casey added, "pity.wish you could inform us on what he has going on below the waist."emma rolled her eyes."you're impossible."she snatched the gown away from casey and then started wrestling noah into the yards of fabric."it wasn't like we were in a relationship.we didn't really even go out together.he came to the house once to bring me dinner and check on me when i was on bed rest, and then he took me to the opera.that was it.""was there no chemistry between you two?"megan asked.without responding, emma pulled noah up into a sitting position and started fastening the row of buttons down the back of the gown."em?"megan pressed.she gave a heavy sigh before picking noah up.she stared into his face before she responded."we had great chemistry together.he was an amazing kisser who got all my senses up and running in all the right ways.besides the physical part, he is smart, kind, and intelligent-any woman's dream."she shook her head."but it didn't matter because he wasn't aidan.i could never, ever love another man like i do him."giving noah a kiss on the cheek, she added, "neither one of us were really in a good place-i was trying to make sure that aidan really was the one, and after being pressured by family and friends, he was trying to date for the first time after his wife's death."megan crossed her arms over her chest."i get that he doesn't need to be hurt, but who is to say that having a fling is going to hurt him?maybe it could give him the confidence he needs to go out and find the real woman of his dreams?"casey snorted."how could a man that looks like that have any self-confidence issues?"megan shrugged."you never know.if he was married a long time before his wife died, he might find it hard to get back into the dating world.especially if the last woman he cared about loved someone else."emma shook her head."trust me, he isn't the fling kind of guy.he wants a wife and children."although megan had a son, she wasn't quite ready for marriage.maybe in a few years but right now she just wanted to date and have fun.she'd willingly sacrificed so much to ensure that mason could have all of her attention since he was short a father.after all, he was the greatest hurdle in her having a committed relationship.she didn't want to open her son up to any hurt that might come from him getting attached to a man she dated only to have them disappear when they broke up."ankle really wants to fix us up?"megan questioned.emma nodded."regardless of what happened with pesh when we were broken up, aidan does respect and admire him.he wants pesh to be happy."she gave megan a pointed look."most of all, he wants that for you, too."megan wrinkled her nose."but i'm really not ready for all of that yet.""then think long and hard before you agree to do anything about pesh.he is unknowingly very persuasive, and in the moment, you might forget your resolve only to have it come back later to hurt you... Or him."megan held up her hands in defeat."okay, okay, i promise."emma smiled."nothing would make me happier than if you were to fall in love with pesh."with a laugh, megan said, "did you just hear anything that i said?i'm anti-love.""so was aidan."just as megan opened her mouth to protest, aidan waltzed into the room."everything okay?""fine.just finished feeding and dressing him," emma replied "good.the natives are getting restless to see the little man of the hour before the baptism."he strode over to them and took his son into his arms."you ready to go work the crowd, noah?"noah's response was to grunt and reach for aidan's tie.with a laugh, aidan announced, "i'll take that as a yes."he then leaned in to kiss emma's cheek."ready mrs.fitzgerald?"she smiled before linking her arm through his."yes, mr. Fitzgerald, i am."megan and casey followed them out the door and down the hallway.they entered a noisy room crammed with family and friends.she left aidan and emma's side to seek out her parents to check on mason.she found her parents, but their arms were empty.in a panic, she demanded, "where's mason?"her father smiled and pointed over to where a pile of her younger cousins were.mason was on the lap of her aunt becky's oldest son, john.mason was mesmerized with what whatever john was doing on his phone.megan smiled as she walked up to them."everything okay?"without taking his eyes off the screen, john replied, "we're fine.""are you sure he's not bothering you?"what she wasn't asking was if john was actually keeping an eye on mason between playing on his phone.john glanced up."considering i have two younger brothers, i think i can handle him.besides, he's really into this game.""okay then," megan replied.she spoke to john's brothers, percy and georgie, before making her way around the room.all her relatives were interested to hear how her schooling was going and how mason was.she had just turned away from talking to her great aunt and uncle when someone pressed up against her back."don't look now, but there's dr. mcdreamy bollywood now," casey whispered into her ear.without hesitation, her eyes scanned the crowd.and then she saw him.ankle was taking him around and making introductions.pesh was impossibly tall and wearing a tailor-made black suit.even beneath the lines of the clothing, she could make out his large biceps and thick thighs.he obviously spent his downtime between hospital shifts working out.his wavy, jet-black hair was cut short, and his dark eyes took in all that ankle was saying.and while she may have been in a church about to stand up as a godmother, she couldn't help the ni**les tightening and panties moistening reaction of seeing him.he was all the way across the room, but he had the same effect as if he were standing by her side, rubbing against her."see what i mean?"casey questioned.megan licked her lips."oh my," she finally managed."sure you don't want to give him a chance?"fighting the urge to fan herself, megan quickly replied, "i'd like to give him many, many chances."chances at ripping off my clothes, chances at kissing and licking me all over my body, chances at allowing his hands, fingers, and the promising bulge in his pants to stroke me until i orgasm... yep, many, many chances.as if she could read megan's mind, casey laughed."oh girl, this has trouble written all over it."chapter three pesh paced nervously around the back of the cathedral.the fact he was in a catholic church wasn't the only reason he felt out of his element.as he eyed the massive statue of jesus, he fidgeted absently with his tie.although emma had sworn aidan was fine with the idea of him as godfather, he was still a little apprehensive about seeing aidan again.the last time they'd been together, pesh was the hero flying aidan from north carolina to atlanta just in time for noah's unexpected birth.but that was six months ago.the euphoria of the moment now had time to fade, and to aidan, pesh could still be the man who almost stole emma away.a side door opened, and aidan stepped out.he immediately met pesh's anxious gaze.when his lips curved into a wide smile, pesh exhaled the nervous breath he'd been holding."well, there you are," aidan said, as he strode up.he bypassed throwing out his hand, and instead, he pulled pesh to him for a bear hug."emma was worried about you.""she was?""yeah, she asked me to come out and see if i could find you.""i'm sorry.i wasn't sure where to go, and no one was out here.""don't worry about it."aidan pulled away."so how the hell are you?"pesh couldn't help laughing at aidan's choice of words, especially in a church."i'm good, thank you."he cocked his head at aidan."and what about you?is fatherhood agreeing with you?"a beaming smile lit aidan's face."i'm absolutely fantastic.i never could have imagined that being a father would be this... amazing."pesh nodded."i want you to know what an honor it is for me to be noah's godfather.""we're glad to have you."aidan patted pesh's back."and i do mean that.""i hope you do.i have had my concerns..." aidan shook his head."well, don't.i'll admit i wasn't too thrilled with the prospect at first, but em was able to make me see the light.you were there for us when we really needed you.i mean, besides my wedding day, i would've missed the most important days of my life-my son's birth.i can never thank you enough.so when it comes down to it, i don't think i could ask for a better godfather for my son."aidan's words touched pesh."thank you.that means a lot.you have my word that i will always do what is right by noah."after giving him a hearty thump on the shoulder, aidan said, "come on back with me.i want to introduce you to everyone.""do they..." pesh wasn't sure how to ask if aidan's family knew the story of how he and emma truly knew each other.aidan chuckled."let's just say that pop's the only one who knows the truth.the others just think you met us when pop had his heart attack."pesh couldn't help the relieved breath that whooshed out of him.it would have been a nightmare to have most of aidan's family hating him for trying to steal emma away."i see."he followed aidan back into a large room filled with chattering people.as he craned his neck, he saw emma in the corner with noah in her arms.she looked radiant as ever in an emerald suit.noah, however, didn't seem too thrilled to be outfitted in the lacy gown that flowed over emma's arms and stopped mid-thigh.his tiny brows wrinkled as he waved his fists back and forth as if any moment he might let loose with a scream.taking him by the elbow, aidan guided him over to a group of men and women.aidan introduced him to his four sisters and their husbands.pesh smiled, nodded, and shook their hands before being bombarded by a hoard of aidan's nieces and nephews."now i want you to meet my niece, megan.she's the godmother.""it would be my pleasure."aidan surprised pesh by leaning in and whispering in his ear."i'm pretty sure over half of the people here are gunning for you two to get together.you know, a real romantic story to tell future kids about how you two met being the godmother and godfather of this sweet and adorable kid."pesh gulped.why was everyone he knew hell-bent on setting him up?had emma harbored some secret, ulterior motive in asking him to be noah's godfather?"i'm flattered, but i don't know if that's such a good idea."pulling back, aidan surmised him before winking."normally i would agree because she is, after all, my niece-my favorite one if i'm being honest.but as much as it pisses me off to admit it, you two would make a great couple.""we would?""hell yeah."aidan swept his hand over his chin."megan needs someone strong and stable like you are, and then you need someone who is so full of life like she is.i can guaran-damn-tee you that you've never been out with a woman like her before.emma is like, one tenths the sassiness that megan is."pesh couldn't help giving aidan a skeptical look."just keep an open mind, okay?"with a reluctant nod, pesh replied, "i will.""megan," aidan called.when the tiny blonde turned around, pesh fought to catch his breath.everything about her from her sparkling blue eyes to her long blonde hair was just like jade's.how was it possible for someone to remind him so much of what he had lost?aidan grinned as he glanced between the two of them."i wanted to introduce you to pesh nadeen, the godfather."thrusting out her hand, megan smiled warmly at him."it's very nice to finally meet you."he stared at it a moment before his good manners overrode his shock.he took her hand in his and shook it."it's very nice meeting you, too.""i'll leave you two to get to know each other," aidan said.before pesh could protest, aidan turned and disappeared into the crowd.he turned to megan and tried clearing his throat of what felt like a wad of sawdust.he knew he should try to make polite conversation, but he was still so shell-shocked by the way megan looked.finally, she took pity on him."so, emma tells me you're a doctor."pesh smiled politely."yes, i am.""what type of medicine?""emergency services."megan's face lit up."oh, how interesting.i'm about to finish nursing school, and i've asked for clinical placement in the er."pesh widened his eyes in surprise.aidan had failed to mention that they had the medical profession in common."really?"megan nodded."i'm hoping to get placed at grady, even though my parents would die a thousand deaths."he cocked his brows at her."i assume they're afraid for your safety?""yes.they can't help worrying about the neighborhood.they sometimes forget i'm an adult, rather than a child.""what is it about grady that attracts you?""besides the fact that it's nationally recognized for its er?"he smiled."yes, besides the accolades."megan tilted her head in thought."i guess it's the fact i really want to feel like i'm making a difference and saving lives.i feel like at grady i would be seeing some of the worst cases imaginable, and in turn some people who really don't have a lot of hope."he was taken aback by her words and the passion with which she delivered them.while she possessed a beautiful exterior, she certainly seemed to have a greater depth of character than he had originally expected.he didn't often meet someone like her.most of the women at the hospital who threw themselves at him possessed only surface beauty.he didn't have to be with them very long to perceive their true shallowness and self-centeredness.to them, he was a prize to be won.he couldn't ever imagine megan feeling that way.she wasn't the type of woman to care about a trophy man on her arm-she wanted to make her own way in the world."it is so good to hear someone speak with such passion about nursing.""really?"he nodded."we desperately need more people like you.i know i would love to work alongside someone who had your passion."she smiled at his compliments.he couldn't help noticing what a nice smile she had.the way it framed her heart shaped face made her appear much less like jade than he had originally thought."thank you.maybe we'll end up together."she licked her lips before adding, "you know, at the same hospital.""i would like that.but i'm afraid that wellstar pales in comparison to grady.""surely the suburbs offer some interesting cases?""they do.i've been there since my residency, so i can't imagine working anywhere else.after all, i wouldn't be standing here today with you if it weren't for wellstar and your grandfather.""that's true."tilting her head, she gave him a very alluring smile."and what a pity that would be if our paths hadn't crossed."he sucked in a breath at the directness of her statement.could she really be interested in him?sure, it was common knowledge that aidan and others wanted them to get together, but he had imagined that she had not known their intentions.and while originally he had been turned off by aidan's suggestion of fixing them up, he couldn't help but be intrigued now.there was something so refreshingly different about megan, despite her physical similarities to jade."mommy!"a small voice cried.pesh glanced over megan's shoulder where a fair-haired toddler came bounding over.he wrapped his arms around megan's thigh.she gave him an apologetic look before bending over."what's the matter, sweetie?"he grinned up at her."miss you."with a smile, she bent over and picked him up.when he sat on her hip, she turned her attention back to pesh."this is my son, mason."pesh couldn't help noticing how megan searched his face to see if there was any judgment or even disgust at her having a son.he felt neither of those emotions.he had to admit he was a little surprised.aidan had failed to mention that fact as well.not to mention, she seemed young to be a mother, considering she was just finishing her clinicals."it's nice to meet you, mason.""can you tell pesh hi?"megan urged."hi, esh," mason said, with a grin.pesh couldn't help laughing, and he was thankful that megan giggled as well."how old are you?"mason held up two fingers to which megan shook her head."he's seventeen months."pesh smiled."you must be very proud of him.""i am."she snuggled mason against her chest."he's the sweetest and best boy i could ever hope for.""you're very blessed.""thank you."they were interrupted by aidan's sister, angie, who pesh had met earlier."looks like it's time to start.come on mason.mommy has to go be noah's godmother now."mason reluctantly went to his grandmother."be good for grammy," megan instructed.after angie walked off with mason, the other family members began filing out of the room.pesh turned to megan and gave her a sheepish smile."i must admit that even though i attended a class with emma, i'm a little unsure of what i'm supposed to do.""it's okay.just follow my lead, and you'll be fine.""thank you."once it was only the two of them and aidan and emma in the room, aidan motioned for them.a priest in decorated golden robes appeared at the door with a gleaming crucifix in his hands.pesh tried not to feel intimidated as the odd man out in the situation.music struck up on the organ, and the priest motioned for them to follow.before they went out the door, emma glanced down at noah."please, please, do not scream in there and act like a demon baby.be the angel i know you can be."he acknowledged her request by sticking his tongue out and flailing his fists.aidan chuckled at emma's plea."relax, babe.if he feels you getting all tense, he's going to get fussy."emma sighed."he's already fussy.he was fine until i put him in the gown.""i guess he feels that wearing a dress is insulting to his manhood," aidan reasoned with a smile.when emma shot aidan a death glare, megan and pesh couldn't help laughing at the two of them.aidan winked at emma before starting out the door.at megan's side, pesh walked up the aisle.when they reached the baptismal font, the music ended, and the priest began speaking.he informed the crowd of what was about to take place and the significance of all the religious rites noah was about to receive.aidan and emma made the sign of the cross on noah's forehead before megan leaned in to do the same.when megan elbowed him, pesh reached over to clumsily follow their lead.after he finished, he glanced at megan.she smiled and mouthed, "good job."he returned her smile.he followed through the rest of the proceedings as aidan and emma pledged to raise noah in the faith.then it came time for him and megan to agree to stand by noah as godparents.the priest took a fussing noah from emma's arms.when the first trickles of water hit the base of noah's head, he cooed and kicked his arms and legs.emma appeared relieved at how noah wasn't behaving like a possessed baby as she had feared."thank god he loves his baths," aidan muttered beside pesh.once the baptism part was finished, the priest made a final talk, and then it was over.just as pesh sighed with relief and was looking forward to making a quick exit, aidan grabbed his arm."don't go anywhere.we have to do pictures."inwardly, he groaned.he wanted, no he needed, a moment alone to process his thoughts.everything had been so overwhelming-being outside his usual world, meeting all of aidan's family, and then having the prospect of megan thrown in as well.awkwardly, he stood around as a photographer came forward and proceeded to take several pictures of aidan, emma, and noah.then it was just aidan and noah or emma and noah."okay, i need the godparents now."pesh smoothed down his tie and allowed the photographer to pose him in the group shot.after they finished with the four of them, noah was handed to megan for pictures with just the godparents.as the photographer pushed megan closer against pesh's chest, he glanced down at her.her reassuring smile caused his heartbeat to accelerate.for the first time, he noticed the sweet aroma of her hair as the long, blonde strands brushed against him.he could also make out the alluring scent of her perfume.he liked the feel of her against him a little too much.it made him want to draw her into his embrace... maybe do other things that he shouldn't be thinking when he was in a church.glancing over her shoulder at him, she joked, "jeez, you're like a giant standing next to me.""am i?"he hadn't noticed the differences in their heights-he'd been focusing on her too much.she laughed."just a little bit.of course, it doesn't take much for someone to make me look short.""you look perfect to me," he said sincerely.craning her neck back to look at him, she gave him a teasing grin."do i?are you flirting with me, dr.nadeen?"he stared down at his feet, trying to avoid the heat of her stare.he tried to hide the red flush he felt entering his cheeks."okay, now just with the godmother," the photographer ordered.reluctantly, pesh stepped away from megan.as the flashes went off, snapping hers and noah's picture, he kept his gaze on her.as she focused on the camera, megan's blue eyes sparkled as she stretched her face into a wide grin.noah's tiny fingers wrapped around some of the strands of her hair, causing megan to yelp in pain."easy now.i got ta keep that," she said to noah."okay, that should get it," the photographer said."here godfather, it's your turn," megan said, as she handed noah to him.by now, noah was tired of being held and tired of being ensconced in yards of lace.he peered up at pesh before howling."i'm sorry, little guy," he cooed, trying to bounce noah in his arms.as noah continued to cry, pesh looked apologetically at the photographer.just before he was ready to give up, megan came up and started clapping her hands and making noises at noah.the baby instantly stopped crying."that's right, noah.give me a smile," megan urged, as she backed up to stand by the photographer.she continued making the noises, and she even resorted to flashing one of the strands of her hair at him.finally, noah's quivering lips broke into a grin."there we go," the photographer said.pesh quickly plastered a smile on his face.after several flashes went off, the photographer put down his camera."got it."both noah and pesh sighed in relief.gazing down at him, pesh asked, "bet you're ready to get home and get out of that dress, huh?""it's a gown, not a dress," megan countered with a smile.he laughed."regardless of what it's called, i don't think he likes it very much."megan brought some of the lace between her fingers."probably a little itchy for him.""did your son wear this gown?""no, this is aidan's gown.mason wore my mother's, which my brothers and i also wore.""i see.""in your culture do they do anything special like this for a baby?"pesh nodded."we have the namakaran, or naming ceremony.it's sometimes held in a temple.and like this, it's all about offering blessings to the child-family and friends coming together in support of the new baby.""i like it."they were momentarily interrupted by aidan and emma walking up.noah immediately reached out for emma."such a mama's boy," aidan muttered, which earned him a glare from emma.he merely winked at her in response before starting down the aisle.pesh saw megan's mother beckoning her with a wave."guess you need to go," he said."but i'll see you at aidan and emma's, right?"she asked.he swallowed hard."um, yes, i'll be there.""good," she replied, with an alluring smile.she gave him a small wave before walking off to join her parents.shaking his head, he mumbled, "this is trouble."chapter four when megan arrived with her parents at aidan and emma's, she was surprised to see a catering truck outside in the driveway.her surprise continued once she got inside the house.gazing out into the backyard, she saw where tables were set up alongside the pool.the tables were adorned with blue and white tablecloths and glittering blue and white centerpieces.a low whistle behind her got megan's attention.turning around, she saw casey shaking her head."wow, this is one epic baptism party," she remarked."it's impressive.that's for sure," megan agreed.as emma breezed into the kitchen with noah in a more comfortable outfit, casey cocked her head."so, i was just wondering where the ice sculptures were?"pink tinged emma's cheeks."i kinda got carried away.with me not working anymore, the old marketing and pr side of me let loose.and with my connections, i was able to get everything ridiculously discounted."megan smiled."everything looks wonderful.you waited so long to have a baby that it makes sense you might go a little overboard."emma wrinkled her nose."i never wanted to be one of those moms who threw the over-the-top parties."while casey started to open her mouth, megan smacked her playfully."it's just catered in food, right?"emma nodded."they did the tables, too.""then i think you're safe from being a momzilla party monster... for now."casey laughed."i'll anxiously be awaiting noah's first birthday party."with a scowl, emma mumbled, "whatever."realizing she didn't see mason, megan quickly excused herself and went outside.she didn't like the idea of him being close to the pool.even with everyone around, it was still too dangerous for her liking.just as her chest started to tighten, she saw him on her papa's lap.the two of them sat at one of the tables underneath the shade of a massive umbrella.several of her other younger cousins sat around them, playing on their psps and other hand-held devices."everything okay?"she asked."we're fine, honey," papa replied."let me know if he gets to be too much."cocking his head, papa demanded, "are you trying to say i'm old or something?""no, not at all.he's a handful even for me."he waved her away with a hand gnarled with age and time."go on and enjoy yourself.i'll keep an eye on mason."she smiled and leaned down to kiss his weathered cheek."thanks, papa."he returned her smile."you know, while you're enjoying yourself, you might go spend a little time with the godfather."megan's eyes widened.was he trying to set her up with pesh like he had with emma?he gave her a knowing look."be good for both of you.""um, okay.whatever, papa," she murmured, before she turned away.although she hated to admit it, she had been looking forward to talking to pesh again.she had tried to kid herself that she hadn't secretly been searching the crowd for him when she was taking in all of emma's decorations.when she did finally catch sight of him, her traitorous heart skipped a beat.she didn't mind if her body gave a reaction, but it pissed her off that her heart was affected by him as well.he'd ditched his suit jacket along with his tie.with the first button of his shirt undone, she could see a tuft of dark chest hair.she bit her lip at the sight.she was a sucker for chest hair.her eyes dipped down to take in how the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to his elbows, giving just a glimpse of his defined biceps.casey had been absolutely right-he was built like a brick shithouse.megan wanted nothing more than to get better acquainted with his body, especially with fewer clothes on him.at the sound of emma's voice behind her, she jumped."ready to eat?"emma asked."um, sure."emma gave her a puzzled look before nodding in pesh's direction."why don't you ask pesh to join you at aidan's and my table?he doesn't know a lot of people, and i would hate to have him end up with the kids."megan quirked her brows in surprise."are you sure?""why wouldn't i be?"with a shrug, megan replied, "i don't know.maybe because you didn't like the idea of me getting to know him."emma shook her head."i never said i didn't want you two to get to know each other-i said i didn't want you using him for a fling."megan couldn't help rolling her eyes."the day isn't over yet.i could still turn on my powers of seduction and lure pesh into a night of seedy passion."emma stared at her in shock before busting out laughing."seedy passion?those words and pesh will never, ever go together in the same sentence.""are you saying that you and aidan have never had seedy passion?""aidan and pesh are not in the same league of men.i love aidan, but he's not necessarily a gentleman.pesh is.""yeah, but you're a lady," megan protested."maybe in the street, but she's one hell of a freak in the bedroom," aidan said behind them.emma squealed before whirling around to smack him."people could hear you," she admonished.as aidan chuckled, megan shook her head."forget other people.me having to hear it was painful enough."crossing his arms over his chest, aidan said, "i came over here to ask if we were going to eat or not?people are getting restless.i had no idea i was going to interrupt such an interesting conversation.of course, i don't think i want to know why the two of you are discussing emma's and my sex life right now."emma waved her hand dismissively."we weren't.and yes, we're ready to eat.let's round everyone up."as emma walked off to call people to sit down, aidan grinned at megan before saying, "total freak."megan closed her eyes as if in pain."spare me.please.""just saying.because you never know if your gentleman might be a super freak too."and with a wink, he walked off to join emma, leaving megan to wonder why everyone seemed so concerned with hers and pesh's love lives.as the sunlight started fading, most of the party guests began to trickle out the door.by the time it was dark, it was only a few of aidan and emma's close friends left.megan had let her parents take a sleepy mason home, vowing she wanted to stay to help emma clean up.the truth was she wanted to spend as much time as she could with pesh.thankfully, she found herself sitting next to him at one of the poolside tables.somehow they managed to end up by themselves after some of the other guests had left.leaning forward in her chair, she asked, "did you always want to be a doctor?"pesh nodded."for my fifth birthday, my father bypassed the usual play doctor's kits by giving me a real medical bag with tools from the hospital.i examined everyone who would stand still long enough, including the two dogs."megan laughed."i bet you were a cute little doctor.""my mother has some embarrassing pictures," he replied, with a smile."so your father was also a doctor?""yes, he had a general medicine practice for forty years.he just recently retired.""did he pressure you to follow in his footsteps?"he grinned."i'm starting to feel like i'm being interrogated."she laughed."i'm sorry if you feel that way.i'm just trying to get to know you.""you're certainly a very attractive interrogator," he said."i think you're avoiding the question by flattering me.""there's flattery and then there's the truth."cocking her brows, she replied, "and then there's not answering my question."he held up his hands in defeat."fine, fine.no, i didn't feel pressure to become a doctor.my father would have never wanted me to pursue a profession where i didn't feel useful."megan smiled."so you've always had a need to help people?""pretty much.as the oldest, i always looked out for my two younger brothers and sister.my mother has always called me an old soul.""i can see that about you."leaning forward, he rested his elbows on the table."now it is my turn to be the interrogator.""okay, i don't mind.""what about you?did you always see nursing in your future?""yes and no.originally, i wanted to be a doctor."his brows shot up in surprise."really?"when she nodded, he asked, "what happened?"there was no way she was going to tell him the truth about her past and why she had been forced to abandon medical school.instead, she shrugged."life happened, i guess.i decided on the next best thing, which was nursing."pesh stared thoughtfully at her."was it your son?""excuse me?""was it your son who changed your plans about medical school?"she shook her head."no, it was before i had mason.""does he... are you...?"pesh shook his head."forgive me.i was being too forward.""no, go ahead.i told you i wasn't afraid to answer your questions."he grimaced."but it's rude to pry, and it's not my business.""just ask your question," she replied.after a resigned sigh, he finally asked, "were you married?""no, i'm not divorced.and no, mason's father doesn't have anything to do with him."anger flashed in pesh's dark eyes."even though i know nothing of him, i know that he is not a man.a man does not abandon his children and his responsibilities.""you would be right.he's just a boy playing at being a man," she replied, glancing down at the table.when pesh took her hand in his, she jerked her head up in surprise.in a soft voice that vibrated with empathy, he asked, "he hurt you very much, didn't he?"as she shifted in her chair, she tried downplaying the moment by wagging her free finger at pesh."now you're really turning the heated questions on me, aren't you?"he quickly released her hand."i apologize."she sighed."no, it's okay."she raked her fingers through her hair as she tried processing if she was really going to be honest with pesh.gazing into his eyes, she didn't detect any judgment or prying-there was only compassion."yes, he hurt me.he continues to hurt me each time i look at mason and realize what he's being denied."she jerked her chin over to where aidan cradled a sleeping noah in his arms.as the others talked and laughed around him, aidan stared down at his son with such love in his eyes and adoration on his face that it cut a jagged hole in megan's chest.her chin trembled as she replied, "i want that for my son."pesh's dark eyes pooled with empathy as he once again took her hand in his."it isn't the same pain, but i do know how you feel.i experience it every time i see a husband and wife sharing a loving moment.it drives home what i do not have... what i have lost."megan wiped her eyes with the back of her hand."emma told me about your wife.i'm very sorry.""thank you," he murmured.nibbling her bottom lip, megan then hesitantly asked, "what was she like?"by his raised eyebrows, pesh seemed surprised by her question.megan hoped she hadn't stepped over a boundary in asking.he leaned back in his chair and drew in an agonized breath."she was my world-the sun, the moon, and the stars."he met her intense gaze, checking to see if she really wanted him to continue.after she gave a brief nod, he began to talk.he told her how they had met and all the little attributes that jade possessed that made her special.as megan listened to him speak with such reverence and love about his late wife, she couldn't help feeling just a little bit jealous.she'd never had a man possess such intense feelings for her.she couldn't imagine ever being loved so completely by a man that not even death could lessen his feelings."what you had with jade, what you still feel for her, it's really beautiful," she murmured when he finished.pesh jerked a hand through his thick hair."it's interesting to hear you say that.i think most women are turned off by what they perceive is a man who can't let go of his dead wife."megan shook her head."i don't think so.who wouldn't be turned on by a man who feels so deeply that he didn't stop loving his wife just because she died?"pesh's eyes widened at her statement, and he sucked in a harsh breath."most women don't want to share your heart," he challenged softly."then they're obviously insecure.all of us have the ability to love people in infinite capacities.i love my son with all my heart and soul, but there will still be room for a man... someday."he stared at her for a moment, unblinking and unmoving."i have to say that i find your reasoning absolutely fascinating.""you do?""yes."the intensity of his gaze caused her to laugh nervously."i don't think a man has ever called me fascinating.""that's a pity."before she could try changing the subject, aidan came by their table with noah in his arms."after i put him down, i'm going to make some drinks.emma wants one of her margaritas.you game?"he asked megan.she nodded.a drink would certainly help cool her off after the conversation she'd been having with pesh."sure.i don't think i've had one in forever.""neither has she.i may be peeling her off the ceiling tonight," he teased.megan laughed."you have seriously got to stop with the innuendo.you are my uncle, and it is mortifying and disgusting to have to think of you in that capacity.""i am so terribly sorry for scaring your sensitive mind."grinning, aidan turned to pesh."beer okay with you, or would you like something fruity, too?""i'm fine with a beer," pesh replied.aidan bobbed his head."be right back."after aidan headed in the house, pesh caught her staring at him."what?"he asked."just surprised you wanted a beer, that's all.""and why is that?"she shrugged."you just seemed a little too refined for beer."he tilted his head at her."what other preconceived notions do you have about me?""none really," she lied.in her mind, she couldn't help thinking how she wanted to make him be dirty just for her.she wondered what other surprises he might have up his sleeve."for some reason, i don't believe that."he crossed his arms over his broad chest."let me guess.you think that i'm a'refined' man who drinks wine, would never think of cussing or have inappropriate thoughts, organizes his underwear drawer, and who considers doing the crossword puzzle a fun friday night?"megan couldn't help snorting at his summation.it was a good distraction not to focus on how he had mentioned inappropriate thoughts and his underwear drawer.at the moment, she was having inappropriate thoughts about his underwear... or hopefully lack thereof.of course, she couldn't help judging him as not being the commando type."no, that's not what i think of you.""i would hope not.i know that since i'm a little older than you-" "just a little?"the corners of his lips turned up."obviously you think i'm an old man.""no, i don't," she blurted."how old do you think i am?just shy of adult diapers and a walker?"she scowled at him."i was not insinuating that at all.i think you're probably close to ankle's age."pesh's brows furrowed in confusion."ankle?"she laughed before explaining where the nickname came from."i see.so just how old is ankle again?""thirty-four.""hmm," pesh murmured."are you younger than that?""older actually.i'm thirty-seven."damn, he was a lot older than her.twelve years to be exact."did i shock you?"he asked, with a teasing lilt in his voice.she shook her head."i'd hardly call thirty-seven old.""it's considerably older than you are, right?""i suppose," she lied.he grinned at her as he leaned on the table with his elbows."and just how old are you?""twenty-five-i'll be twenty-six in a few months.""twenty-five going on twenty-six.""yes.""i must be positively ancient to you."he held out his hand and examined it."i might have a liver spot or two."she smacked his hand playfully."shut up.thirty-seven is not old.""see any grey hairs?"he asked, bending over to where his delicious head of hair was in front of her face.her fingers itched to run through the dark strands.her mind ran straight to an illicit image of her fingers tugging on his hair as he went down on her, jerking too hard when he sucked and licked her until she came, and then stroking the damp hair back from his forehead as he rose up to cover her body with his.she cleared her throat that had run dry."no, of course not."he jerked his head up to wink at her."then there's hope for me yet.""i would think so."aidan appeared then, carrying all the drinks on a tray."i expect a tip when you guys finish," he teased."i'll remember that," megan replied.after jerking his chin toward the table next to him, aidan said, "why don't you guys come over here with us?"she fought the urge to slap him.she was enjoying having pesh to herself."um, sure.okay," she said, reluctantly rising out of her chair.when they changed tables, she was glad to see pesh take the empty chair beside her, rather than across from her.once she got settled in, she wasn't lamenting her seat change too much.between casey, and emma's other best friend, connor, the table was kept in raucous laughter.it was good being with a group of friends.after she had gotten pregnant, she didn't have much in common with her sorority sisters anymore.then when she became a mom, she rarely saw anyone from her old group.her life moved in an entirely different orbit than theirs now.the conversation and laughter flowed as easily as the drinks.megan found herself halfway through her second margarita when she started feeling funny.a flush filled her cheeks at the same time she felt clammy.as aidan came back with another beer, she asked, "did you put something different in this one?""yeah, we ran out of the tequila i got for the party, so i gave my favorite niece a good dose of sierra silver.""what?"megan demanded.aidan's brows furrowed behind his tipped back beer bottle.once he swallowed, he asked, "does it taste bad?"megan pinched her eyes shut.the room was beginning to spin around her a little.as she brought her hand to her forehead, she heard a smack across the room and aidan cry, "ow, dammit, em!""that tequila is a hundred and fifty proof alcohol, aidan," emma chastised."sorry.i didn't realize it.i just thought it was the better stuff because it was white tequila.that's your drink of choice, not mine."oh god, she was in so much trouble.she'd barely consumed any alcohol since she got pregnant and had mason.now she'd had one regular dosed margarita and almost a full one of straight alcohol.a gentle hand landed on her thigh."are you all right?"pesh asked.she opened her eyes to see two blurry images of him staring at her with concern."not exactly.""would you like me to take you home?""yes, please.while i can still walk."as she rose out of her chair, she swayed a little in her heels.after taking two steps, aidan's apologetic face appeared before her."i'm sorry, meggie.""it's not your fault.and i'll be fine."she wagged a finger at him."but when i get shit for coming home drunk, i'm so telling mom it was your fault."he smiled."i'll gladly take the blame and fear angie's wrath."he leaned in to hug her."thanks for today-you know, for being noah's godmother.""you're welcome.thanks for me asking you."she shook her head."i mean, thanks for asking me."god, this was bad.after exchanging hugs with emma and reassuring her at least twenty times that she would be fine and that she did need to go home, pesh led megan out the front door.he slid a strong arm around her waist to steady her as they went down the porch steps.as she staggered to the car, she moaned."i can't go home yet.not like this."she stared up into his face."i can't let mason see me like this."he pushed a strand of hair out of her face."don't worry.i'll take you to my house then.""just so i can sober up?"she questioned, although she really didn't mean it.she wanted to go to his house for a lot more, especially after being so close to his fabulously built body."yes, of course.i'll make you some strong, black coffee.""thank you," she murmured, trying to still the spinning of her head."you're welcome."always the gentleman, pesh opened the door for her, and she collapsed onto the seat.once he made sure she was comfortable, he closed the door and went around the front of the car.megan gazed around at the plush interior of the jaguar with its leather seats and sleek console.after pesh slid into his seat, he put the key in the ignition and cranked up.as they started backing out of the driveway, she glanced over at him."do you have to come to the rescue women of drunken."she shook her head."i mean, drunken women a lot?"she asked.wait, was she slurring?he cut his eyes over at her and smiled.he seemed to be trying really hard not to laugh at her."not exactly.but i'm always happy to help a damsel in distress."megan giggled.oh god, now she was giggling?she never giggled.she eyed pesh suspiciously."got a hero complex, huh?wan na be every woman's knight in shining armor?""not every woman's," he murmured."mmm, pesh, you wan na be my knight in shining armor?"as soon as the words left her lips, she fought the urge to slap her hand over her mouth.alcohol always had this effect on her-it left her completely without a sensor.pesh's jaw clenched, and he didn't reply.pitching her upper body over the armrest, she got as close to him as she could."you didn't answer my question."taking his eyes momentarily off the road, he pinned her with an intense gaze."i'd be anything and everything you wanted me to be, if you would give me the chance."momentarily dumbfounded, she could only stare at him."oh wow," she replied, as she collapsed back onto the seat.the motion caused her to feel dizzy.mumbling almost incoherently, she said, "mmm, hot as f**k and anything i want.lucky me.""i have a feeling you wouldn't have asked the original question if you weren't intoxicated."with a snort, she replied, "drunk or sober that woulda been a helluva line to hear from a man.""i'm glad you think so."after spending a few moments in tense silence, megan leaned forward to flick on the radio."do you mind?""go ahead."humming along with one of the songs, she laid her head back on the seat."i won't hurt your ears by singing.""do you not sing?""oh, i sing, but i don't do it well.emma's the one with the voice.""so i've heard."turning to look at him, megan asked, "did she ever sing for you?""sadly, no."megan harrumphed as she crossed her arms over her chest."she made out with you, but she wouldn't sing for you?that's just rude."pesh made a strangled noise."emma told you... about us?""mmm, hmm."she grinned at him."i hear you're a great kisser."cutting his eyes over to her, he gave her a pained look."it really wasn't like that for us.i mean, we weren't in love with each other.""yeah, that's what she said.course, she did admit that you got her all hot and bothered.""s-she did?"he stammered, embarrassment coloring his cheeks."hey, the ability to get a woman hot is nothing to be ashamed of.hell, i got turned on when i first saw you today.like my panties got wet.""megan, don't," pesh warned, gripping the steering wheel to where his knuckles turned white.turning in her seat, she eyed him before licking her lips."you don't want me to say how you got me hot in a church?how you still get me hot acting all bashful about the sex talk?""please.just don't.""fine," she muttered, before flouncing back in her seat.she didn't speak to him for a long time.instead, she closed her eyes and laid back with her head cushioned on the head rest.when the car started to slow, she snapped her eyes open.she didn't know if she fell asleep or passed out.sitting up, she peered out the window at the posh houses of the subdivision they were in.as they pulled into the driveway, megan couldn't help staring up at the house."holy shit, this place is beautiful."pesh chuckled."thank you.""i know you think it's just the alcohol talking, but i'm serious.you have great taste.""i hope you'll like the inside just as much.""i'm sure i will."after he came around to open the door, she hopped out of the car a little too fast.her wobbly legs wavered, and she ended up crashing into pesh's chest.staring up at him, she gave an apologetic smile."sorry about that.""it's fine.need some help?"with the alcohol fueling her libido, she replied, "if it means having your hands on me, then sure."pesh grimaced, but his arm still came around her waist to steady her.she loped along beside him.after he unlocked the door and punched in the alarm code, she followed him inside.her blurry vision took in the expansive kitchen with his gleaming stainless steel appliances.she followed him as he made his way into the living room.motioning toward the couch, he said, "why don't you have a seat while i fix you some coffee?"while it was a nice idea to sober herself up, she didn't want any coffee.she just wanted pesh.grabbing the lapels of his suit coat, she pulled herself flush against him."when did you put this back on?"she wondered aloud.she felt so tiny against his massive chest.it was a good feeling though-one of safety and protection.it also lit her even more on fire with lust.cocking her head, she glanced up at him to survey his expression.even in the semi-darkness, she could see his dark eyes burning with desire.she ran her hands up his chest to his neck.she tugged him down to where his face was inches from hers.fortified with liquid courage, she brought her lips to his.she couldn't help the little moan that came from deep in her throat.pesh's mouth was warm, soft, and inviting.the brief connection made her want him all the more-for him to devour her.tentatively, she slid her tongue across his bottom lip, beckoning him to open for her.almost instantaneously, the warmth of his tongue met hers.they slid against each other, tasting, searching, and seeking.he gripped her face in his hands, holding her captive as his tongue plunged in and out of her mouth.emma had been right-the man could kiss like there was no tomorrow.he knew when to be gentle with his mouth and then when to switch to more demanding, almost conquering kisses.if he could practically make her soak her panties with just a kiss, what the hell could he do with his dick?as she started to feel lightheaded and weak on her legs, they stumbled over to the couch before pesh collapsed back, taking her with him.straddling his lap, she gazed at him momentarily before his mouth attacked hers again.as his tongue once again invaded her mouth, she began to raise her h*ps and grind against him.groaning, he broke the kiss by throwing his head back.he gulped in long breaths of air like he was a dying man deprived of his last breath.she felt the same way.she kissed a trail over his chin and down his neck."pesh, i want you," she murmured into his skin.his chest heaved up and down with her declaration as if he was finding it hard to breathe.she broke away to stare into his eyes."please."chapter five pesh couldn't believe the delicious nightmare he found himself trapped in.a beautiful, sexy blonde writhed against him.the hem of megan's dress had ridden up to her hips, and a tiny scrap of lace underwear was the only thing covering her core as she rubbed herself against his crotch.her heat and her arousal scorched through the fabric of his pants to singe the skin of his growing erection.he wanted nothing more than to flip her on her back, tear away the underwear, and plunge himself deep inside her.it had been so, so long since he had been within the tight walls of a woman.while his conscious railed against him for even entertaining the thought, his body was onboard."please," megan whimpered, as she continued to rise and fall over his erection."we can't... we shouldn't."she ran her hands up his chest before wrapping them around his neck."but i could make you feel good.""i'm sure you could.""and i know you could make me feel good, too.i'm already drenched just kissing you."her fingers raked through his hair, tugging desperately on the strands."i need this, and you need this."his body was completely onboard with how much he needed her.if she pressed any closer to him, she was going to set him off and make him do something he hadn't since he was a teenager, which was come in his pants.but his once hazy mind was starting to refocus and overpower the desire pumping through his body.he could not and would not take her when she was drunk.it was completely against his character.he'd never taken advantage of a woman, and he never would.he gazed into her hooded eyes."but it would be so very wrong."her lip trembled."don't you want me?""yes, without a doubt.""then why won't you have sex with me?""because you're inebriated."she rolled her eyes in a huff."you're sooo proper, aren't you?a proper gentleman."he cupped her face in his hands."if not taking advantage of you in your state of intoxication makes me a gentleman, then i suppose i am.what kind of man would i be to take you now only to have you wake up with regret and remorse?""the kind of man who wants to get laid!"her hand dipped between them to grasp his erection, causing him to hiss."i feel you against me-i know you want this as much as i do."although the devil on his shoulder raged at him, he quickly removed megan's hand."believe me when i say i won't have sex with you like this.i would never disrespect you so much as to not make love to you like you deserve."she blinked a few times as if she was having a hard time processing his words."regardless of what you have going on in that head of yours, you are better than this.you deserve a man who will take his time with you and show you what pleasure through making love really is.""i've never had that," she whispered regretfully.he gave her a sad smile."i didn't think you had."he brushed the hair out of her face and cupped her cheek."if i take you, i'll be making love to you.i'll have you begging and pleading, but you'll be coming so many times you'll lose count.you'll understand the difference between a quick tumble and the all-consuming power of a physical connection fueled by an emotional one."she rapidly blinked her blue eyes in disbelief while her cheeks flushed."oh god, did you actually just say that?""i did."he gave her a teasing smile."and you'll be calling out my name more than his.""i..." she began before she quickly clamped her lips shut.her eyes widened before she scrambled off of his lap.before he could question her on what she was doing, she threw up all over the front of her dress.when she wavered on her feet like she was going to collapse, pesh tumbled off the couch, reaching out for her.grabbing both of her shoulders, he steadied her.she glanced down at her dress before gazing back at him.pesh's heart ached at the sight of tears pooling in her eyes."are you all right?"her chin trembled before big, fat tears slid down her cheeks."oh god," she whispered."please don't cry.""t-this is s-so embarrassing," she hiccupped."it's okay.you don't have to be embarrassed."moaning, she covered her face with her hands."first, i made a fool out of myself coming on to you and now i've puked in front of you like some sorority girl who can't handle her liquor.""stop beating yourself up.come, let's get you cleaned up."he slid an arm around her waist to steady her on their way down the hall to the bedroom.she continued to weep softly as they made their way into the bathroom.using his free hand, he flicked on the light."can you stand in the shower?"with a weak nod, she replied, "i think so.""if not, there's a ledge you can sit on.let me turn on the water for you, and i'll get you a towel."he propped her up against the counter before striding over to the shower.once he felt the water was a good enough temperature, he then went over to the closet.he pulled out a towel before returning to megan who had her head in her hands.with his free hand, he took one of her hands and pulled it away from her face."please stop beating yourself up.i hate to see you so upset.""i can't help it.i'm such a fool.""no, if you're a fool, then so am i.we both wanted each other.""but i got drunk... i never get drunk anymore.""it was an accident.things like that happen."he cupped her chin and forced her to look at him."you are none of the negative things your mind is calling you right now.""really?"her broken expression, coupled with her need for his reassurance, nearly crushed him.he had to fight from taking her in his arms.he knew if he did that, he would end up doing something he shouldn't with her.finally, he nodded."but you do smell, so go on and get in the shower."the corners of her lips curved up in a half smile."do you have something i can change into?and maybe a toothbrush?"he nodded."one second."leaving her in the bathroom, he went back into the bedroom to his closet.he took out a pair of scrubs he knew would be too big and too long for her and then coupled it with an emory university t-shirt.when he got back to the bathroom, megan was struggling with the zipper at the back of her dress.with a defeated expression, she dropped her hands."could you please help me?""of course."he sat the clothes down on the counter.he then reached up to tug down the zipper.the back of the dress gaped open, exposing her cream colored skin and navy blue lace bra and panties.he closed his eyes to try and block out the glaring images rocketing through his mind.his lips on her skin, his tongue licking up her spine, his hands curving around her ribcage to cup her br**sts.he forced himself to step back.clearing his throat, he replied, "done."glancing at him over her shoulder, megan gave him a weak smile."thank you."he took out a spare toothbrush from underneath the counter and placed it next to the clothes he'd brought her."let me know if you need anything else.""okay."whirling around, he strode out of the bathroom.not wanting to go too far in case megan needed him, he began pacing around the bedroom.he momentarily faltered when he heard the shower turn off.he waited for her to appear, but she didn't.just as he was about to knock on the door, the whirring hum of the hairdryer started.he continued his pacing as she dried her hair.next, he heard the sink water turn on as she brushed her teeth.when it was quiet once again in the bathroom, his feet froze as he stared anxiously at the bathroom door.when it opened, pesh's breath caught.appearing fresh-faced and clean, megan looked so beautiful as she tentatively stepped into the bedroom."everything okay?"he asked.she jumped at his voice."um, it's fine.thank you again for the clothes and for letting me shower.""you're more than welcome.and there's no need to thank me."chewing on her lip, she glanced from the bed to him."i texted my mother to tell her i was staying the night at emma's."before he could say anything, she quickly added, "thank you for putting my purse in the bathroom.that was very thoughtful of you.""you're welcome," he replied.then he thought of her text."so you're staying at aidan and emma's?"after all, the last thing he needed was to have her here-a reminder of what he couldn't have.it would be enough to drive any man crazy.megan shook her head."do you mind if i stayed here instead?"when he started to open his mouth, she shook her head."i promise no funny business.i just don't want to go home yet.if you don't want to me to stay, you can take me to emma's.""of course you can stay.""i can sleep on the couch or in the guest room."he shook his head."you'll sleep right here."he walked over to his massive king-sized bed.he turned down the covers before glancing back at her."come on.getting some rest will make you feel better."she eyed him hesitantly."i really can't take your bed.that would be imposing.""i don't mind.i promise.""only if you're sure?""i'm sure."tentatively, she started walking over to him, her eyes never leaving his.she eased down onto the mattress before sliding beneath the sheets.when she appeared comfortable, he covered her up.as he started to go, she reached out to grab his arm."no, please don't go.don't leave me alone."his brows shot up in surprise."you want me to stay with you?""yes, please.""in this bed... with you?"when she nodded, he exhaled a ragged breath."megan, i don't think that's a good idea.""don't overthink it; just stay with me."although his brain was raging war at him to make the sane and responsible decision, he replied, "give me a few minutes.""okay," she replied softly.turning, he strode into the bathroom.he didn't bother glancing in the mirror because he was pretty sure he wouldn't like what he saw.instead, he stripped off his suit and tie.although he probably should have thrown on more clothes, he left his boxers on and grabbed a white shirt off the hamper.after pulling it over his head, he went back out into the bedroom.megan lay on her side in the bed, her face turned toward the bathroom.her eyes were closed, but they popped open the moment he entered the bedroom.without a word to her, he walked around the other side of the bed and climbed inside.lying on his back, he propped one arm over his head.his other hand rested on his chest.he twisted his fingers into the fabric of his shirt over his heart.somehow he wanted to still the erratic beating.just when he thought he might be comfortable, megan turned over to face him."you're so far away," she whispered."i thought it was for the best."the corners of her mouth momentarily turned down in a pout.then she inched closer to him.he sucked in a breath and tried not to hiss when he felt her head nuzzle against his chest.before he could stop her, she had thrown an arm around him.thankfully, she didn't try anything else.and within a few minutes, her labored breathing signaled she had fallen asleep.pesh stared up at the ceiling and willed himself to be able to go to sleep as easily.surprisingly, as megan's soft snores echoed against his side, his eyes grew heavy.for the first time in two years, he fell asleep with someone in his arms.chapter six sunlight streamed across megan's face, causing her to squint her eyes tighter closed against the bright invasion.she was warm and comfortable, and she didn't want to wake up.but the tranquility of her morning was shattered when a soft snore came from behind her.it was far too deep to be one of mason's.panic prickled its way up her skin.where am i?her eyes frantically scanned the room.overcome by both masculine decor and smells, she realized she was in a man's bedroom, or more importantly a man's bed.she hadn't woken up this dazed and confused since she got hammered for the first time.she couldn't even remember what day it was.this was bad.very, very bad.she had to get out of there and get home to mason.what kind of mother was she to wake up in a strange man's bed?as she tried to roll over, she found herself entrapped by a strong arm wrapped around her waist.her gaze flicked down to the tan, muscled arm.who the hell did that belong to?a whimper escaped her lips.oh god, had she actually slept with a man she had no memory of?never in her life had she made such a mistake as that.nausea overcame her, and she knew she needed to get out of bed and into the bathroom.she shoved herself so hard away from the person that she ended up elbowing him in the ribs.he groaned."oh, i'm sorry.i didn't mean to hurt you," she quickly apologized."it's okay, megan," he murmured drowsily.that voice.it took only a second for her to register who she was in bed with.and with that realization, everything from the night before came crashing down on her.she had accidentally gotten drunk off her ass, pesh had taken her to his house to sober up, and then... oh god, she had come on to him like a brazen floozy.she buried her head in her hands and moaned."hey, how do you feel this morning?"he asked."like i've been run over by a truck.""want me to fix you a good hangover cure?"she peeked at him through her fingers."you actually know a hangover cure?"he smiled."you think someone like me has never been drunk?"when she bobbed her head, he laughed."i'm sorry to disappoint you, but there have been many, many times i've woken up just as you are now.""that's hard to imagine."she gazed down at the scrubs and t-shirt she was in.although she doubted it, she couldn't help but ask."did we..." "no, we didn't."she arched her brows in surprise."if we didn't sleep together, then why did you... i mean, why are you in bed with me?""because you begged me to stay."she gasped in horror.wasn't it enough that she had thrown herself so wantonly at him, but now she'd begged him to stay with her?"i did?"he nodded."you said you didn't want to be alone."vaguely she remembered pleading with him to lie close to her.what a nightmare."i'm so sorry.""don't apologize."when she started to protest, he held up a hand."i have to admit it was nice being in bed with someone again-feeling their warmth, the softness of their body as they lay beside you."he swallowed hard."i've missed that more than i knew."overcome with the emotions threatening to overtake her, megan didn't know what to say.all she knew is she needed to get out of there."i need to get home... or to emma's.i can't let my parents think i stayed out all night with a man i just met.""i understand.i wouldn't dream of compromising your reputation."she stared at him for a moment.sometimes the way he spoke made it seem like he was from a different world or time period."i, uh, i need to use the bathroom.""go ahead."tumbling out of the covers, she then streaked across the room.once she closed the door behind her, she exhaled the breath she'd been holding.she made it to the toilet just in time to throw up again.she wondered after doing the same thing the night before how there was anything left in her stomach to empty.once she finished, she leaned over the sink, pooling water in her hand before bringing it to her mouth.after gargling to rid herself of the nasty taste, she eventually dug under the counter for some mouthwash, and then brushed her teeth.without a hairbrush or comb, she did her best to tame her out-of-control hair.once she surmised that she looked presentable enough to face the firing squad, aka aidan and emma, she left the bathroom.pesh had thrown on some clothes and stood in the middle of the room.he raised his brows expectantly at her."i'm ready to go now.""of course."when she started for the bedroom door, she abruptly stopped."wait, my dress?""i'll send it out to be dry cleaned.""oh," she murmured."thank you."in silence, they made their way through the house.megan tried not to be so obvious as she took in the high ceilings of the living room, the floor to ceiling windows that overlooked a large, spacious yard.pesh had an amazing house-one that was far too big for just him.it certainly was made for a family-the one he sadly didn't have.as he started to open the door leading out to the garage for her, pesh stopped and turned around.staring intently at her, he said, "i'd like to see you again."megan couldn't help the shocked gasp that escaped her lips.she'd made a repeated fool out of herself the night before, and he still wanted to see her?"you can't be serious.""i am."she gave a slight jerk of her head."i don't think that is a good idea.""but why?"he countered sincerely.with a contemptuous snort, she replied, "isn't it obvious?""if you're alluding to the fact you accidentally got drunk last night and then became ill, that has little relevance to me.accidents happen, and i'm man enough to realize that."he closed the gap between them."i liked being with you yesterday."remembering what emma had said, megan couldn't help asking, "you want to date me, don't you?""yes of course.what else would i want to do?"when she replied, "have sex," a flush entered his cheeks."that is not what i meant.""and that's a pity."his brows furrowed."whatever do you mean?""you and i... we want different things.you want to date and get married again, right?""yes, that is something i desire very much."she shook her head."but i don't want to be in a serious relationship right now with you or anyone for that matter.i'm certainly not ready to get married anytime soon.i just wanted to have some fun with someone."pesh frowned."i don't think i understand.""what i want from you is the same thing i wanted last night.just sex," she answered honestly."you don't want to date me... You only want to have sex with me?"if the situation hadn't been so dire, megan might've laughed at the horrified expression on pesh's face.he appeared absolutely floored that she could ever think of only using him as a sex toy.finally, when she gathered herself together, she shook her head."i'm sorry, but that's the way i feel."she braced herself for some sort of wrath out of him or even a lecture.what he did was even more surprising.he gave her a sad smile."and i'm sorry you feel that way because i would have really enjoyed getting to know you better."without another word, he opened the door.always the gentleman, he waited for her to go through first.tucking her head to her chest, she bypassed him to walk to the car.once again, he appeared to open the car door for her."thank you," she murmured.he nodded before walking around the front of the car.without another word to her, pesh cranked up, and then began backing down the driveway.the ride to aidan and emma's was only twenty minutes, but it seemed to take an eternity.the painful silence hung heavy around her.pesh didn't look at her.instead, he kept his gaze firmly on the road ahead of them.when he pulled into aidan and emma's driveway, megan felt her stomach clench.she wished there was some way to make things right between them.but she had a feeling she had gone too far and said too much.as he put the car in park, he turned to look at her."thank you for the ride," she said."you're welcome.it was my pleasure.""most of all, i want to thank you for taking care of me last night.you truly went above and beyond.i can never thank you enough.""you don't have to thank me.i'm glad i was able to help you."nibbling on her bottom lip, she finally allowed herself to say what she was holding back on."i wish things could be different," she said softly.when she dared herself to look at him, she found him staring intently at her."i'm sorry, too.take care of yourself.okay?"she bobbed her head."the same to you."with trembling hands, she fumbled for the door handle.when she was finally able to open the door, she stumbled out onto the pavement.as she made her way up the driveway, she could feel pesh's eyes on her.the car remained parked as she climbed the porch steps and rang the doorbell.she hoped that noah was already up, and she wasn't waking the household.aidan threw open the door."megan?what the hell?"he asked.his question and concern caused her to burst into tears."why are you crying?"aidan demanded."it's a long story."he glanced from her out the door to pesh's car.his expression darkened."did pesh hurt you?""no!of course not.""if he's made you cry, i don't care whether he's noah's godfather or not.i'll punch his lights out!"she grabbed his arm."stop it, ankle!it's not him, it's me.it's all my fault.okay?"he stared at her in surprise."what happened?""give me some coffee and a chance to calm down, and then i'll tell you everything."although his expression was skeptical, aidan nodded, and then started to close the door.megan stole one last glance of pesh as his car started reversing down the driveway.she hoped for her sake and his it was the last time she would have to see him.chapter seven megan nervously tapped her thumbs on the steering wheel of her car.her clinical placement had come through, and she was now on her way to make her introductions to her preceptor, the nurse who would supervise her.although she had initially been disappointed in not receiving grady, she was still excited to be doing the last part of the journey to becoming a nurse.she was also grateful she hadn't received the night shift that some of her fellow nursing students had.she would have rarely been able to see mason if she had to sleep during the day and work at night.she pulled into the parking lot of the wellstar er and eased into the first space she found.after turning off the car, she grabbed her folder of paperwork along with her purse and headed inside.she stopped at the front desk."i'm not a patient.i'm a clinical student here to see kristi parkman.""go on through," the receptionist said, before she buzzed open the authorized personnel only door.breezing inside the heart of the er, megan couldn't help feeling excited.she couldn't wait until she got her feet wet by working with patients.glancing around, she wasn't exactly sure how she was going to find the preceptor.she stopped at an area teaming with nurses."can i help you?"one of them asked."yes, i'm here to see kristi parkman."a tall blonde woman in her fifties came over to her with a beaming smile."you must be ms.mckenzie?""i am.""it's so nice to meet you."megan smiled."it's nice meeting you, too.""we're so very glad to have you.i've taken a look at your transcript, and it's quite impressive.""thank you," megan replied."why don't i show you around today?that way you'll be ready to go with the flow tomorrow.""sounds good."with a smile, kristi led her around the maze of rooms.she pointed out where the medicine room was, the trauma area, and where she would find the break room.each time they passed a nurse or a doctor, kristi was quick to introduce megan."everyone seems very friendly," megan mused."it really is a great place to work.now, i'm not going to lie that some of the residents can be real ass**les.but we're so lucky to have a supervisor who is such a sweetheart.""that's wonderful.""yes, everyone loves dr.nadeen."megan's heartbeat slowed to a standstill.nadeen.no, it couldn't be.surely there were more doctors with that last name.searching her mind, she tried desperately to remember where he said he worked."oh good, he's just down the hall.let me introduce you two.""no, that's really isn't necessary," megan protested feebly.ignoring her, kristi called, "dr. nadeen, come meet our newest nursing candidate."the moment he turned around, megan felt like she was going to throw up.after spending two months trying hard to forget about her infamous night with pesh nadeen, there he was right in front of her.she couldn't help having the classic line from casablanca flash in her head, "out of all the gin joints in all the world, she had to walk into mine."she certainly felt that way about all the hospitals she could have possibly been assigned to, she had to be assigned to his.the shock and surprise registered on his face as well.he was quick to mask it by smiling warmly at her."hello again, megan."kristi's brows shot up at the familiarity of pesh's greeting."you know each other?""um, well," megan began.how was she going to explain?the last thing she needed was to get off on the wrong foot with her coworkers.pesh nodded."she and i share a godson.""oh how wonderful."kristi patted megan's back."what luck for you then ending up here out of all the hospitals?""yes, what luck," megan murmured.kristi smiled."well, i'll let you two catch up for a minute or two.""no, that's okay.you don't have to do that," megan protested.waving her hand dismissively, kristi said, "it gives me a chance to go grab a snack and something to drink.be back in a few, and we'll finish the tour."megan fought the urge to run after kristi as she walked off.instead, she turned back to pesh who was staring expectantly at her."you don't exactly look happy to see me," pesh said.she shook her head wildly."how could i be?the man, who i completely made an ass out of myself in front of, is at the hospital where i'm doing my clinicals.that doesn't exactly make my day.""for the last time, you have nothing to be embarrassed about.""sorry, but that does not make me feel any better," she grumbled."what can i do to put you at ease about working with me?"rubbing her now aching head, she replied, "i don't know.if i thought it wouldn't make me look bad, i'd request a transfer.""i offend you that much?"pesh asked.as she gazed up at him, his expression was wounded."no, no, you don't offend me.it's just that..." she chewed mercilessly on her bottom lip before she continued.after taking a ragged breath, she replied, "it's just that for the past two years, i had pretty good control of my life.the night i was with you, i let all that control crumble.by getting drunk, i became someone else-someone i used to be.the girl, or woman, who would do anything to get a man's attention.i don't like that person very much, and i don't ever want to go back there.seeing you just makes me remember all of that."megan couldn't help being surprised by how honest she'd been able to be with him.pesh remained silent for a moment.his dark eyes bore into hers."i am sorry that you reflect so negatively on the night we were together.for me, it was not marred by drinking or you getting sick.i enjoyed spending time with you and getting to know you."he swallowed hard."i enjoyed waking up with you.i would give anything for you to be able to look at me without having to feel bad about yourself.""you really enjoyed being with me that night?"he nodded."when i told you i wanted to see you again, i was serious."she sighed."that's very sweet of you, but i haven't changed my mind about dating.""you haven't?"with a shake of her head, she replied, "i have too much going on in my life right now to get involved with someone.it wouldn't be fair to them... to you.especially since we still want very different things from each other.""i see," he replied.megan noticed the sadness that darkened his expression."i'm sorry," she murmured."you have nothing to regret.any grief i'm experiencing is once again my fault."he gave her a rueful smile."i seem to keep falling for women who aren't meant for me."she sucked in a harsh breath at his words."falling?you are... You were falling for me?"pesh opened his mouth to reply, but at the sound of kristi coming back from the break room, he shut it.closing the gap between them, he whispered, "don't worry about working with me, megan.we'll always be friends, and i will respect your wishes and your distance."for some reason, his words had the opposite effect they should have, and regret ricocheted through her.finally, she managed to say, "thank you.i appreciate that."with a smile, he then turned and walked away.she heaved a painful breath as kristi walked up to her."such a sweetheart, isn't he?""yes, he is," megan murmured."not bad on the eyes either."a nervous giggle escaped megan's lips."no, he's not.""i swear that half of the women here in the er act like they're in heat whenever he comes around."kristi fanned herself."i mean, that body, those eyes, and those dimples.lord, if i wasn't a happily married woman, what i wouldn't want to do to that man!"megan knew exactly what kristi meant.unfortunately, she was never going to get the chance to experience it for herself.somehow she'd managed to find the only man left in the world who wouldn't partake in just a sexual relationship.no, pesh had to want more than she was willing to give."did you hear what i said?"kristi asked.megan snapped her gaze from pesh's retreating form back to face kristi."i'm sorry what?"kristi laughed."oh no, i'm about to lose another one to dr. nadeen's charms, huh?"shaking her head wildly, megan replied, "no, no, we're just friends-i don't feel anything like that for him."kristi winked."yeah, just keep telling yourself that, honey."chapter eight as pesh exited one of the exam rooms, he saw megan sitting on a stool at the counter, working on a chart.when the door shut behind him, she jerked her head up and caught him staring.he cleared his throat and walked over to her."hello," he said, pleasantly."hi.""so, are you settling in?"she nodded."everyone has been so nice and helpful.""good.i'm glad to hear that.we usually have very good success rates with our clinical candidates."megan smiled before her head dipped back down to work on the chart.nervously, he scratched the back of his neck.things were rolling along with them now that he knew he shouldn't try to rock the boat.after all, he had promised her he would keep his distance.but he couldn't help himself.in the two months since their first encounter, he hadn't stopped thinking about her.now that she had shown back up in his life so out of the blue, he couldn't help feeling that it was fated.ask her to dinner, his mind shouted.he bit down on his lip to keep the question he was burning to ask from escaping his mouth.finally, it rushed forth before he could stop himself."why don't you let me buy you dinner after work?"megan's scribbling pen stilled on the chart.she glanced up and cocked her head at him."dinner implies a date, and i thought we were clear on that."he gave her a nervous smile."well, i was only offering some less palatable cafeteria food.i hardly think that constitutes a date.""in my realm of dating consciousness, any time you sit down at a table while eating and drinking together, it is a date."crossing his arms over his chest, he countered, "if that were true, it would mean you were dating your father and brother every time you sat down together.i know your family is close, but i don't believe they're that close."megan's brows rose."oh, is the good doctor cracking jokes now?""perhaps."the corners of megan's lips turned up."then what exactly would you consider a date?"pesh leaned back against the wall, surmising her teasing smile."a mutually agreed upon event.""you're so proper," megan teased.he rolled his eyes at her, something he rarely did until he began spending more and more time in her presence."and you're avoiding the initial question."megan put down the pen and chart and crossed her arms over her chest."so, if you could take me on a date, where would we go?"pesh rubbed his jaw in thought."well, if would have to be something you would want to do, but i would begin with dinner."when she started to protest, he held up his hand."somewhere that was romantic with candlelight and soft music-perhaps a place where we could dance in between courses."staring at him in surprise, megan replied, "you're serious?""of course."she slowly shook her head back and forth."okay, go on.""once we finished wine and dessert, i would then want to take you somewhere you've never been-" "like your bedroom?"megan interjected with a smirk."i do believe you've already been there before."the teasing faded from megan's expression, and a flush entered her cheeks."may i continue?""yeah," she murmured."i would want to be with you to experience something you never have before-an art gallery, an opera, a musical.anything that would bring wonderment and excitement to your face."he gave her a small smile."and it would mean all the more that i was getting to share it with you."he watched with almost mild amusement as she processed his words.most likely she had never had a man speak to her the way he was, and it was certainly affecting her.feeling like it was time to go in for the kill, he asked once again, "so, will you have dinner with me?"pesh leaned forward expectantly as megan opened her mouth.they were interrupted by the sound of emma's voice."oh thank god.i'm so glad you two are on."her anxious tone was the only thing that could have torn pesh's attention away from megan.he glanced from emma to aidan, who was grimacing and rubbing his head."what happened?"emma replied, "he fell and hit his head," at the same time aidan grunted, "nothing."megan stepped forward and went over to aidan.she gasped as she surveyed him."ankle, your pupils are huge!"pesh took his penlight out of his coat pocket and went to aidan.as he flashed the light into aidan's eyes, he grimaced."yeah, they are.what exactly happened?"he made sure to direct his question to emma since she appeared to be the only one being honest."we were at my ob's for our first ultrasound."pesh's eyes widened."ultrasound... you're pregnant?""again?"megan questioned by his side.the concern for aidan on emma's face washed away and was replaced with a beaming smile."yes, i'm eight weeks.""why didn't you say something at dinner sunday?"megan asked."well, i only found out two weeks ago, and we wanted to wait to tell everyone until we had the first ultrasound."megan's blonde brows creased."so what does the ultrasound have to do with ankle hitting his head?"emma pursed her lips and cut her gaze over to aidan."would you like to tell them?"when he shook his head and then winced, emma sighed."when they hooked me up to the fetal monitor, they thought they heard two heartbeats.at the word'twins', aidan passed out and hit his head on the counter and the floor."while pesh quickly turned a laugh into a cough, megan wasn't so tactful.she burst out laughing."you seriously passed out during the ultrasound?"aidan scowled at her."in my defense, it wasn't quite the ultrasound yet."at megan's continued laughter, he shrugged."it was pretty mind-blowing news.""oh ankle, honestly."aidan turned to pesh."so am i going to stand around all day getting shit, or are you going to examine me?"pesh nodded."of course.your pupils are definitely a matter of concern."glancing at emma, aidan said, "just wait for me here.""okay."pesh motioned for aidan to go into the first examining room.as soon as the door closed behind him, aidan lunged for him, grabbing the lapels of his white coat."i need a vasectomy.today."pesh fought the urge to laugh at the absurdity of the situation as well as aidan's desperation."okay, let's get you to sit down.you've obviously been through a lot of trauma in the last hour."aidan plopped onto the examining table.he buried his head in his hands and groaned."what a f**king nightmare of a day.""does your head hurt?"pesh asked."a little.""any nausea?""maybe."pesh furrowed his brows."what do you mean, maybe?"aidan raised his head."if you're asking if i'm nauseated now, the answer would be no.i'm not.but on the other hand, if you're asking if i get nauseous thinking about the fact that emma could have been pregnant with twins, and i would have had three kids under two and in diapers..." aidan shuddered."then yeah, i get really f**king nauseous, and the room starts to spin a little."easing down on his stool, he rolled over to aidan."take a deep breath for me, okay?"aidan's chest expanded as he inhaled and exhaled."again," pesh instructed.after a few cleansing breaths, pesh cocked his head at aidan."better?""yeah, a little," aidan croaked.he jerked his hand through his hair."are you going to get me a referral for a vasectomy?"pesh held up his hand."i'm confused.if you know that emma isn't having twins, why do you want to have a vasectomy?""because twins run on both sides of our families.pop was a twin, and emma's uncles are twins.it's like we have a genetic bull's-eye hovering over us.we can barely be in the same room without conceiving, so it's just inevitable that she'll get pregnant again, and then i'll have four kids... maybe even five."aidan swallowed hard as some of the color drained from his face."i can't be a baby making machine.""actually, most recent studies still conclude that identical twins can happen to anyone, whereas, fraternal twins are the result of the mother producing two eggs in a single cycle.this tendency to create multiple eggs is passed from mother to child.given that emma doesn't have a non-identical twin, you are fairly safe."aidan tilted his head, his expression one of confusion."so you're saying i don't have to worry about that?""without knowing emma's full genetic history, i couldn't say, but it sounds like a no-at least for fraternal twins."after processing pesh's words, aidan shook his head."like it really matters about the twins.we're still way too fertile together.i need to stop this before it gets out of hand.""and what does emma think about all of this?"a red flush entered aidan's cheeks."um, well, i haven't actually mentioned it to her.""you don't think your wife needs to know about such a life-altering decision?""well, of course i'd tell her before i went in for the surgery."as pesh crossed his arms over his chest, he couldn't help wondering just how hard aidan had been hit in the head."you can not seriously be sitting there saying that."aidan stared at pesh for a moment before he groaned."oh man, i'm being a giant, selfish tool about this, aren't i?"pesh smiled."pretty much."aidan rubbed his hand over his eyes."it's just... being a father is f**king scary sometimes.i worry about noah constantly, and now there's another baby in the mix.plus, another baby means more time taken away from emma."he gave a weak smile."i love her so much.sometimes... i just can't get enough of her, and i don't want to share.""i think that's a perfectly normal feeling."aidan shook his head."it makes me sound like a selfish bastard.i mean, who is jealous of their kid for taking their wife's time?""a lot of men.so stop beating yourself up over what you're feeling.most of all, don't bottle it up.talk to emma."aidan's blue eyes widened as he shook his head furiously back and forth."oh hell no, i don't want her thinking badly of me.""she won't.emma always appreciates honesty.""about me being jealous of her time with our kids?i'm pretty sure she would not want me being honest about that.""what has emma always said is the most important thing in a relationship?""trust."pesh nodded."so how are you building her trust by lying to her about your feelings?"aidan's blonde brows furrowed."so i should just tell her i'm afraid of losing her and that i want us to maximize our time together?""i would think so.i don't think any woman could get angry hearing her husband say how much he loves her and wants to be with her."aidan appeared thoughtful."i guess you're right."pesh smiled as he patted aidan's shoulder reassuringly."you're doing a wonderful job being a father.i'm sure you'll do just as well with a second and maybe even a third child."at the mention of a third child, aidan swallowed hard, his adam's apple bobbing up and down."i don't mind a third kid... just not now.maybe in a couple of years."he glanced up and smiled at pesh."but thanks for the vote of confidence on me being a father.""i just call it as i see it.""i appreciate that.""how about i check on your head now?"aidan nodded."okay."pesh started feeling for unusual lumps and bumps on aidan's head."hmm, i don't feel anything abnormal.but just to be on the safe side, i want you to have a ct scan to rule out concussion or any brain bleeds.""jesus, i could have all of that from just hitting my head?""you would be surprised.let me go call in the order, and they'll come take you back.hopefully you won't have too long a wait.we're usually slower during the afternoons when the doctors' offices and imaging centers are open."as he started for the door, aidan stopped him."hey, man, with all the craziness, i almost forgot to ask how is megan doing with her placement?"pesh didn't have to think twice before responding, "she is going to make an incredible nurse."aidan grinned."i'm glad to hear it.not that i ever doubted her abilities.it's just good to hear her praises sung by a doctor."popping pesh on the chest teasingly with his hand, aidan asked, "how's it going between you and megan?"pesh almost laughed out loud at aidan's forthrightness.it was not in his nature to be so blunt, and after megan turning him down yet again, he wasn't really sure how to answer."i truly respect and admire megan."he considered that the most diplomatic way to answer her uncle's enquiry.despite feeling glad that he obviously had earned his friend's respect, he wouldn't say anything untoward about megan in front of him.it is her business who she did or didn't date."that's not what i meant.""i didn't imagine it was."aidan eyed him before saying, "look i know you got off to a rocky start, but it's not hopeless.are you planning on asking her out?""you're not letting this go, are you?""nope.not a chance."pesh shoved his hands into his lab coat."i have asked megan to accompany me on a date, but at this point, we are at a stalemate.but, i am not planning on giving up anytime soon.does that satisfy your inquisition?"aidan laughed, but then his brows furrowed."what do you mean?you two looked pretty cozy and comfortable together when we walked up."with a regretful shake of his head, pesh replied, "she doesn't want to date me.""i call bullshit.i may have been bonked in the head, but no one could deny the way she was looking at you.maybe if you-" although it was against his character, he let his anger override his better judgment."she wants me for sex but not for a relationship, okay?"aidan's mouth gaped open."you mean, she's acting like... A dude?""if you mean that she has pretty much refused to go to dinner with me or any other honorable event that a man and woman can partake in on a date, and instead, she would rather pursue a strictly physical relationship, then the answer is yes.""my god, it's like she's turned into the old me," aidan muttered.he ran his hand over his face before he looked at pesh again."i'm so sorry."with a shrug, pesh replied, "she's still very young.i suppose in her eyes, she's been deprived of fun the last two years.this is a way for her to make up for that.regardless if we agree or understand it.""well, i still call bullshit on the whole thing."he gave pesh a long, hard stare."you have to keep trying, no matter what.""i didn't say i was giving up, did i?""no, but i know from personal experience how hard it is to keep trying when it feels like you aren't winning.""what occurred with you and emma is totally different than with megan and me.""you still have to try."aidan hopped off the examining table and wobbled for a moment on unsteady legs."megan has been hurt before, and i don't think she really knows what it is to be loved.not deeply where her needs were considered.hell, she was only twenty-three when she got knocked up.i want her to find someone who will cherish her, man.i want my girl cared for."he patted pesh's shoulder."i think that someone could be you.""we'll see."when aidan started to argue, pesh shook his head."time to see about your head.""whatever," aidan mumbled.when pesh opened the door for aidan, emma and megan stared expectantly at them."so what's the verdict?"megan asked."i think he's going to be just fine, but to be on the safe side, i've ordered him a ct scan."emma's eyes widened in fear."you think he has some brain injury from the fall?"she asked in a panicky voice.pesh smiled to try and put her at ease."i don't think there's anything wrong besides a slight bump on the head, but i want to make sure there is nothing wrong with him.""okay then," emma replied.an orderly appeared with a wheelchair to escort aidan to his scan.before he sat down, aidan leaned over to kiss emma."i'm fine, babe.stop worrying.it isn't good for you or the baby."she gave him a weak smile."i'll try hard not to."he winked at her before collapsing down in the wheelchair."nothing can keep me down-you should know that by now."megan snorted."at least we know the bump didn't do anything to your ego.""of course not," emma agreed.kristi poked her head out of one of the examining rooms."dr. Nadeen, i need you."he nodded before turning to megan."why don't you show emma to one of the family waiting rooms?""sure," megan replied.emma reached up to hug him."thanks for taking care of aidan.""it was my pleasure."he gave them a final wave before disappearing into the waiting patient's room.but after talking to aidan, he definitely had a little more determined bounce in his step.chapter nine two days later when megan came in for a later shift, she found the emergency room in a state of chaos."whoa, what happened?"she asked kristi, after she'd clocked in and put away her things.kristi rolled her eyes."every month or so we seem to have a day where everything is madness from start to finish.you can never anticipate it-you kinda just have to go with the flow."she grinned at megan."so get ready to be on your toes today."megan laughed."okay, sounds good."as they started working their way through patients, things continued to escalate into overwhelming territory for megan.kristi seemed to be experiencing the same feeling since the tops of her cheeks had a shine of perspiration beads on them.the moment they finished with one patient and disinfected the room, another patient was waiting to enter it.megan followed behind kristi as she went to poke her head in to the registration area."hey janet, could you not call anyone else back?we're getting swamped."janet shook her head."it's just as crazy out in the waiting room.like we're almost overflowing."kristi rolled her eyes."fabulous.it's probably another full moon, which makes things absolutely insane."she turned back to megan."listen, since we're so swamped, can you take the man in exam b?"megan couldn't help her eyes from widening."really?on my own?"kristi smiled before patting megan's hand."i've seen you in action the last week.i have faith in you.""okay, if you're sure.""i'm positive."megan couldn't contain her smile."thank you."taking her ipad, she flipped open the registration details on the patient awaiting her.when she pushed open the door, she eyed the man on the examining table."good evening mr. Robertson, i'm megan.what-" before she could even get out the standard "what seems to be the problem?"question, the man started shaking his head furiously."no, no.i won't let you examine me.i want a doctor.a male doctor.you understand?""sir, i understand, but i have to follow protocol, which is to ascertain your issues before the doctor comes in.i see on the chart that you're experiencing some abdominal swelling?"he refused to meet her eye.instead, he gazed over at the wall before holding up one finger to her."i meant what i said.i demand to see a male doctor.""yes, but we're very backed up this afternoon.i'm not sure how long it will be before you are able to see a doctor, least of all a male doctor."when it appeared the man's resolve was fading a little, megan took a tentative step forward."please, if you would just let me take a look at your abdomen.""it isn't my stomach," he mumbled."then what is it?"when he didn't respond, she sighed with frustration."mr. Robertson, you can not ignore abdominal swelling.it can stem from many issues and have many repercussions."he shifted uncomfortably on the table.just when she thought she was making headway with him, he threw his head back and began screaming at the top of his lungs."get me a male doctor!"megan rolled her eyes.the first time she had the chance to see a patient on her own, and he had to be a stark raving lunatic.refusing to give into him or accept defeat, she stalked over to him.she was going to exam his sexist ass if it was the last thing she did."keep screaming, and i'll call security," she warned before snatching the sheet off him.his screams cut off to a shriek as he clawed for the sheet, but the damage was done.she had seen more than enough."oh.my.god," she murmured.she gazed wide-eyed and open-mouthed at what had to be the poster child picture to go along with the warning labels on viagra and cialis for four-hour erections."that's going to have to be aspirated.""excuse me?"he demanded.she cocked her head at him."the excessive blood in your penis?"he nodded."it's not just going to go away on its own.it has to be aspirated, which means drained out."mr. Robertson swallowed hard."like with a needle?""yes, with a very large needle."when he started to protest, she brought her hand up."lucky for you, i can not do the procedure-it is to be handled strictly by a doctor.""a male?""if it came to your penis exploding from the pressure by waiting for a male doctor, would you seriously be that picky?"his blue eyes widened in horror."yeah, i thought so.i'll be back."when she whirled out of the room, she ran right into the last person she wanted to have to deal with at the moment."i'm so sorry.are you all right?"pesh asked."i'm fine."he smiled down at her."doing some patient evaluations on your own?that's wonderful.""um, well, yes and no."his brows knitted in concern."what's wrong?"she couldn't imagine telling pesh about mr. Robertson's condition.the last thing she was going to do was refer the case to him.draining an engorged penis should be left to the interns, not an attending physician."oh, it's nothing.he's just a little demanding."at that moment, the door to the exam room flew open.mr. Robertson stood hunched over, his legs an almost painful distance apart.he took one look at pesh and his white coat, and he lunged at him."help me.please!"although it was strictly against the nursing code, she would have loved nothing more than to have throttled mr. Robertson right then and there.pesh grasped mr. Robertson's hands on his coat and pulled them down."sir, you need to get back inside.as unsteady as you are, you certainly do not need to be on your feet."as pesh led mr. Robertson back to the examining table, megan reluctantly followed them inside the room and closed the door."what seems to be the problem?"mr. Robertson glanced from pesh to megan and then back to pesh.with a sheepish expression, he replied."um, i seem to be having some lower abdominal swelling."megan had to fight from rolling her eyes.she stepped between pesh and mr. Robertson and looked pesh full on in the eye."while the patient refuses to acknowledge his condition, it appears after examination that he has an extreme priapism."at the word, color flooded into pesh's tan cheeks, and he broke eye contact to momentarily stare down at the floor.his reaction was exactly what megan had feared she would experience in the moment.she had hardly imagined his level of professionalism would allow him to be embarrassed about a medical condition.but of course, their past interactions made anything of the sexual kind a little more mortifying than if she was dealing with one of the male interns.it took pesh only a few seconds to recover, and then he immediately turned his attention to mr. Robertson."did you take any erectile dysfunction medication in the last four to six hours?"when mr. Robertson started to look at megan, pesh shook his head."my nurse will stay with me through the duration of your care.so i will repeat once again, did you take any medication?""cialis.""how many milligrams?"when mr. Robertson shrugged, pesh demanded, "are you being purposefully evasive, or do you not know?""i don't know, okay?i got it off a buddy of mine.""do you normally take medication that isn't prescribed to you?""i just wanted to try it out."pesh glanced over at megan."i'm going to ask for a full blood work-up.who knows what else he might've taken."megan nodded and punched in the code on the electronic chart to get a member of the phlebotomy team up to draw the blood.after going over to the dispenser, pesh slid a pair of rubber gloves on."i'm going to have to examine you now."with a resigned huff, mr. Robertson threw the sheet back.megan bit down on her lip to keep from laughing at the expression on pesh's face.she was pretty sure he hadn't had to deal with a lot of penises that resembled enormous eggplants in his career.of course, her amusement quickly faded when she realized how awkward it was being in the room with him while he held another man's penis in his hand.she tried busying herself with the electronic chart in front of her.she wanted to do anything but look at the scene unfolding before her.once pesh finished that part of the exam, mr. Robertson eased back down on the examining table, and pesh once again eyed the eggplant-colored penis."precisely how long have you had the erection?""five and a half hours.""there doesn't appear to be any artery rupture, so we won't need to perform surgery.i think the quickest form of treatment, as well as the least invasive, would be to try an injection to narrow the veins and reduce the blood flow to your penis.that should reduce the swelling."mr. Robertson's eyes narrowed suspiciously."and where do you have to give me the shot?""in the penis, of course."with a gulp, mr. Robertson replied, "fine.do it."pesh nodded."can you grab a syringe of alpha-agonist please?""sure," megan replied.she gladly retreated from the room to head to the medicine closet.after checking the syringe dosage, she reluctantly returned to mr. Robertson's room."thank you," pesh said, as he took the medication from her.she watched with mild disgust, as well as fascination, as he took mr. Robertson's penis in his hand."take a deep breath," he instructed.the moment the needle pricked the skin, mr. Robertson howled uncontrollably.megan couldn't help rolling her eyes at what a complete pansy he was being about the pain.once pesh finished, he dropped the empty syringe in the biohazard container and then glanced back at mr. Robertson."if the swelling hasn't begun to dissipate in the next ten to fifteen minutes, we're going to have to take another course of action.""what's that?"mr. Robertson questioned, with a grimace."aspirating the penis of the blood."mr. Robertson paled considerably."oh god, she mentioned that."he said the word she like megan was a swarm of locust.pesh turned to smile at megan."then she made a good call."he then eyed his pager that was going off."keep an eye on him.i'll be back in fifteen.""okay, i will."time ticked by agonizingly slow as she worked on charts and kept an eye on mr. Robertson.every few minutes, he was lifting up the sheet to eye his erection.each time he grimaced, megan imagined that the shot wasn't working and the swelling hadn't gone down.when pesh entered the room again, he glanced from her to mr. Robertson."so how are we doing?"she shook her head."no change.""i see."he went over to a drawer and searched through it before producing a very large syringe with a very thick needle."i'm sorry, mr. Robertson, but it looks like this is our only choice."mr. Robertson seemed speechless for the first time all night."ms. Mckenzie, can i get you to assist me?"pesh asked."of course.""i need you to help restrain him.i need him to be as still as possible."megan fought the urge to roll her eyes at his suggestion.mr. Robertson had to outweigh her by a hundred pounds, not to mention that when pain got your adrenaline pumping, you were even stronger.but she did as she was told.as pesh brought the needle to mr. Robertson's penis, she gripped her hands tight into his shoulders.when the needle pierced the skin, it took everything within her to keep him on the table.gritting her teeth, she held her ground.finally, when the last of the blood had been withdrawn, she was able to loosen her grip.pesh tossed the syringe into the biohazard container and then turned around."i advise you take some ibuprofen for both the pain and for the anti-inflammatory benefits.i would also do a round or two of using an ice pack on your crotch.it would be my strongest advice that you never take anymore erectile dysfunction medication until you actually need it.""whatever," mr. Robertson croaked, collapsing back onto the table."give him about thirty minutes, and then he needs to head on home.we'll need the exam room," pesh instructed."okay, i will."he gave her a quick smile before exiting the room.after thirty minutes, she saw mr. robertson to the door of the er.as he staggered into the waiting room, she shook her head."megan," kristi called."yes?""go ahead and take your dinner break now.""are you sure?i mean, i can work through it since we're so busy."kristi shook her head."we're fine.besides, you're going to need all your strength.things are probably going to get even crazier after the sun goes down."megan tried not to appear horrified at the prospect.instead, she ducked into the break room to grab her purse.when she came out, pesh was waiting for her."where are you going?""oh, it's my dinner break."pesh gave an impish smile."how fortunate.it's mine as well."realizing what he was intending, she slowly shook her head back and forth."no dates."after crossing his arms over his chest, pesh asked, "and how would it be a date if we happened to go to the cafeteria at the same time and sit at the same table?""you're pushing it, and you know it.""after what we both just endured, how can you deny me the pleasure of buying your dinner?"a teasing twinkle flashed in his dark eyes-one she wasn't used to seeing on him.for some reason, she found it completely irresistible."besides, how can i possibly have romance on my mind when i just held another man's penis in my hands?"her eyes widened in shock at his words."d-did you actually just say that?""yes, i believe i did."she shook her head."i can't believe you sometimes.""don't try to pin me as one thing or the other.just take me as i am," pesh suggested."i'll try."as they started to the elevator, megan chewed her lip with unease.turning to pesh she asked, "what will people say if they see the two of us together?""that we're two single people having dinner," he replied."you're a physician, and i'm a clinical student.couldn't i get in trouble?""doctors and nurses often have dinner together on their breaks.the cafeteria is a pretty inconspicuous place for us to be alone together.if someone came upon us in one of the medicine rooms or an empty patient room, then we might have a problem.""if you say so," she mumbled, as he punched the down button on the elevator.after they stepped on the car, pesh eyed her."you really are worried, aren't you?"she nodded."my career means everything to me.i don't want to do anything to jeopardize it.""then i'll make sure we don't sit by ourselves.""thank you.i really appreciate that."as the car started its decent down, pesh threw his head back and exhaled a long breath."well, that was..." megan grinned at him."the good doctor seems speechless.surely in all your years in the er, you've seen crazier or more mortifying cases."he cocked his head, appearing thoughtful."a screwdriver lodged in a rectum is probably the tamest.""the tamest?"megan questioned incredulously, as the elevator door dinged open.pesh laughed."a man high on meth walking into the er with his penis in his hand is probably the craziest."megan's hand swept over her mouth."he actually cut off his..." she gazed around to make sure no one was listening to their conversation."is the good nurse speechless?"he teased.she rolled her eyes at him."so what happened?""we got him sedated and into surgery as soon as we could.i heard they were able to sew it back on.i'm not aware of whether or not it was ever... Fully functional again.""that is crazy.""i know."pesh handed her a food tray.as they surmised their choices, megan asked, "was that your standard line of questioning in a situation like that?""i think we've established that i haven't been privy to many priapism cases, but yes, any time there is an issue with the penis that is not related to the urethra or bladder, you would ask those questions."after the food service worker gave them both an odd look, pesh looked pointedly at her."why do you ask?"she shrugged."just to be prepared for the next time."he cocked his brows at her."do you want to practice your line of questioning?you know, show me what you've learned?""let's get our food first, shall we?""okay."after deciding that the grilled chicken salad was about the most appealing item in the food line, she grabbed a drink and some of the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies.just as she inched up to pay, pesh put his tray next to hers.he had chosen some kind of stir-fry that didn't look appetizing to megan.when she dug in her purse for her wallet, he handed a twenty to the cashier.as he took his change, she shot him a look."what?"he asked."you buying my dinner doesn't look very innocent," she hissed, as they started toward the tables.pesh shook his head with a smile."i highly doubt she's keeping the gossip mill going on how dr. nadeen bought the lovely new clinical student a salad.""you never know," megan countered.trailing pesh, she watched as he made his way over to a table filled with doctors and nurses.while the bottom half was filled with people, the top was practically empty."mind if we take these seats?"pesh asked."go right ahead, nadeen," a bushy haired doctor replied."we're expecting a few more to join us," he said, before covertly winking at megan."you play a good game," she said, softly."thank you."she'd just finished drizzling dressing over her salad when pesh said, "ready to prove yourself?""are we really going to talk about this while we eat?""you'll learn that most lunches and dinners are spent either reviewing cases or getting input on cases.""fine then."putting on a professional air, she asked, "have you taken any erectile dysfunction medication?"after swallowing a bite of stir-fry, he replied, "no, never.""do you have trouble obtaining an erection?"the twinkle returned to his eyes."i would think you wouldn't need to ask that question after our previous encounter."a shiver went down her spine as she remembered her core rubbing against the hardened ridge in his pants."considering it is unlikely that i would have any previous knowledge of the patient, just answer the question."he gave her a sly smile."no, never.""do you have trouble maintaining an erection?""i could once again point out that you had personal knowledge of how well i was able to maintain myself once aroused, but i'll refrain.instead, i'll say no.""ha, ha, nice way to get your point in.""i had to try."she cocked her head at him, giving him a teasing smile."if a patient was trying to flirt as much as you are during my questioning, then i would have to remind him that i am a professional.""i see.then forgive me for trying to undermine your professionalism.""you're forgiven... For now."he took a long swig of his iced tea."you did really well back there.""really?""yes, you did.for that to be your first case on your own, you managed to keep yourself together and to give the patient the best level of diagnosis and care you could."she couldn't help the warmth rushing to her cheeks that his compliments caused."thank you.i appreciate your confidence.""i think you're going to make an amazing nurse.i know that there will be many hospitals vying to hire you."megan shook her head."i don't know about that.""don't underestimate your talents.""you think they would want to hire me here?"she asked.his brows rose in surprise."you wouldn't mind a permanent placement here?"she shrugged."it hasn't been long, but i have been happy here.i like the people i work with.i guess i wouldn't want to go into the unknown when i know what i have here."he swallowed a bite of his rice."that's understandable."after wiping his mouth, he smiled at her."i think they would be crazy not to make you an offer.""i hope so."leaning in over his plate, he held her gaze.the intensity in which he stared at her caused her to shudder.she didn't like the effect he was having on her in the middle of the hospital cafeteria.a mixture of emotions coursed through her-warmth, safety, lust, happiness.she hadn't experienced that range of feelings with a man in a long, long time.finally, he spoke."i know it would make me very happy to have you here, and i would do everything within my power to ensure you stayed."before she could reply, a tray smacked down onto the table next to her.one of the residents, a young male named dr. Morris, grinned at the two of them."so, i hear you two just handled a priapism case.""yeah, we did," megan replied.she didn't dare look back at pesh to gage his expression on being interrupted.dr. Morris groaned."oh come on.give me the juicy details.i haven't gotten to see one of those yet.the best groin swelling i've had is when some idiot tried to pierce his balls, and they got infected."when megan wrinkled her nose, pesh's laughter surprised her.her gaze flew to him, and he winked."i told you that the conversations we had over dinner were not exactly appetizing.""i'm starting to believe you," she replied, with a smile.somehow she managed to devour the rest of her salad while pesh told dr. Morris the ins and outs of the case.after she finished, she rose out of her chair."i guess i better head back.you know, with everything being so crazy."surprisingly, pesh didn't get up nor did he offer to walk her back.instead, she saw an acceptance on his face that told her he was letting her go so there would be no suspicion raised about the two of them."thank you for dinner," she said."you're welcome," he replied, with a smile.his smiles were starting to do something to her that she didn't like.they were no longer igniting her panties on fire; instead, they were making her long to spend time with him.she quickly slung her purse over her shoulder and strode out of the cafeteria.with the chaos surrounding her, she thankfully put pesh out of her mind for the rest of the evening.chapter ten after two exhausting weeks in her clinicals, megan was ready for a little randr.so she was thrilled when emma called her asking if she wanted to join her for a girl's day.she was even more stoked when emma said that aidan was willing to keep mason, so he and noah could play together.even though she was sure her parents would have watched him, she hated imposing on them so much.an hour after the call, she was pulling into aidan and emma's driveway.when she opened the backseat to get mason out, he was already bopping up and down in his car seat with excitement.he loved aidan and emma's house, and he especially loved playing with noah, even though they were eleven months apart.she grabbed him and his diaper bag and then made her way up the front walk.emma answered the door with noah on her hip."hey, i'm so excited you could make it."megan grinned."you should know by now i have no life except for mason and work.""i feel the same way sometimes," emma replied, as megan stepped through the doorway.as she walked through the foyer and down the hall to the kitchen, mason squirmed to get down.once she set him on his feet, he ran into the living room.that's where aidan was lounging on the couch with beau on the floor next to him."beau!"mason cried.he leaned in to hug the massive lab.megan never had to worry about beau and mason; he was truly a gentle giant when it came to infants and kids.beau thumped his tail heartily at the attention.aidan glanced up from the tv and smiled."hey, how are you?"she grinned as she reached down to kiss his cheek."good thanks.and you?""great.looking forward to having a man's day with the boys."megan laughed."yeah, with two kids under two, let's see how much fun you'll have."aidan shrugged."it's good practice for me when the new baby gets here.""baby or babies?"she teased.with his eyes widening, he quickly replied, "baby singular.that was confirmed, thank god."cocking her head, she teasingly asked, "and when is the ultrasound to confirm the youngest fitzgerald granddaughter is on her way?"aidan huffed exasperatedly."not for a few more months, smart-ass."she brought her hand to her chest in mock outrage."it was just a question.""yeah and considering you've had a kid yourself, i'm sure you know all too well at what month the gender ultrasound is."megan grinned."i just think it's cool that i'll be the oldest granddaughter, and she'll be the youngest."with a pained expression, aidan groaned, "whatever."she ruffled his still unkempt bed hair playfully."relax, ankle.you're going to be an amazing father to that little girl.she'll undoubtedly have you wrapped around her finger before she's even out of the womb.""a man like me, or i guess i should say, a man like i used to be, does not want to bring forth daughters into the world.""payback is a bitch," she mused."don't i know it," he grumbled.emma came into the living room then.she handed noah to aidan along with a bottle."you sure you'll be all right today?""i'll be fine-we'll be fine.won't we mason?"mason glanced up from lumbering around the room on beau's back."yeah!""see.stop worrying."he gave emma a very pointed look before adding, "a promise is a promise after all."she flushed a little at his words, but then gave him a shy smile.when he winked playfully at her, megan couldn't help feeling her chest tighten at the exchange.seeing her once man-whore uncle now a loving, devoted husband and father was always surprisingly unnerving.but deep down, it was how much she truly wanted what aidan and emma had.love, companionship, and devotion within marriage while having someone else to parent with you.if you weren't so stubborn you could probably have something just like aidan and emma have with pesh!but no, you have to keep believing that you're too young to get married.you're probably throwing away happiness with both hands just because you're afraid.emma brought her out of her self-deprecating tirade."so what should we do first?"she asked, as they walked into the garage."nails and toes?"megan suggested."mmm, that sounds good."they both slid into emma's suv.as megan buckled up, emma turned to her."i hope you don't mind that casey is meeting us for lunch?""of course not.the more the merrier.besides, casey is a hoot."emma smiled and cranked up the car."that she is."before long, they were pulling into starbucks to grab some coffee for megan and tea for emma.then they walked around the corner to the nail salon.after relaxing manicures and pedicures, they drove about twenty minutes to meet casey at their favorite little local restaurant that was housed in an old train depot.as they walked up, they saw casey sitting outside in the sunshine texting."hey girl!"emma called.casey waved to them before rising off the bench."hello, hello."a round of hugs was exchanged between the three women."i thought you two would never get here.i'm starving."emma grinned."sorry.they were a little behind at the nail salon."they pushed through the front door and were quickly seated by the hostess who knew them well.once they eased into a familiar, comfortable booth, they took stock of the menus."you have to order alcohol on our behalf since we're both two knocked-up ladies now," casey insisted.megan's eyes widened."i didn't know you were pregnant."casey grinned."yeah, nate finally wore me down."she then shook her head."sometimes i think he's the chick in this relationship.""he must've done some heavy convincing," megan said.with a nod, casey replied, "he comes from such a large immediate and extended family that he's been itching to have a child.we've been married a year and together eight, so i guess it was just time.and while i wasn't thrilled with the idea of having a baby when his internship was so crazy, his hours will be better by the time the baby gets here.""when are you due?""around the same time as emma."that statement made emma beam."our babies are going to be best friends, too.i just know it."casey grinned at the sentiment."or boyfriend and girlfriend..." "that's a thought."emma jerked her chin up."i'm not sure i want your son corrupting my little girl."with her dark eyes widening, casey huffed, "and what if it's my daughter that your son is corrupting?"emma giggled."if my son takes after his father, then that would be the case.but i think we also have to consider that if your daughter is anything like you, she'll be the one doing the corrupting."casey laughed."that's true.""guess i should keep mason clear of her too, huh?"megan asked, with a smile."probably," emma replied.after the waitress appeared to take their drink and food orders, casey pinned megan with an intense stare."so," she began, quirking her brow at megan."i hear your doing your clinicals under dr. Mcdreamy bollywood."megan couldn't help but laugh."if you mean i'm doing them under dr. nadeen, then the answer is yes."emma nibbled on her bottom lip before speaking."have things been awkward considering what happened the night of noah's baptism?"before megan could reply, casey's eyes bulged."whoa, whoa.hold the phone.something happened between you two?"megan felt heat rising in her cheeks.it was almost too mortifying to repeat, but finally, she filled casey in on each and every embarrassing detail that had happened."man, he's so freakin' honorable, isn't he?"casey mused."yes, he is," megan replied, glumly.emma shook her head."there's nothing wrong with his honor.it's what attracted me to him in the first place.there are so few gentlemen left on the planet."before she could stop herself, megan blurted, "but i didn't want a gentleman.i wanted to get laid."casey grinned."don't we all?"emma rolled her eyes."just when i think your pregnancy hormones haven't made you even more sex crazed, you go and say something like that," she grumbled.megan twirled the straw in her diet coke thoughtfully."what's bizarre is even though he should have been completely and totally turned off by what happened that night, he's still interested in me.i mean, the man is gorgeous and has half of the women in the hospital panting over him, and he still wants me.""then what's the problem?"emma asked."he's interested in dating, not sex."emma's brows furrowed."but wouldn't you have sex eventually if you were dating?"megan sighed."we're at a stalemate-i just want straight sex without dinner and a movie, and to quote him, he wants to show me a whole new world through a date.""how aladdin of him," casey quipped to which emma shot her an exasperated look.with a shrug, megan replied, "basically we're going to stay forever in the friend zone because neither one of us is willing to give in.""would it really kill you to go out with the guy?"casey asked.megan widened her eyes in surprise."you mean, you of all people are actually advocating me giving in to him?"she jerked her thumb over at emma."i'd expect that out of her but not you."casey dabbed the corners of her lips with her napkin."it's just a date.i don't think he's going to drug you and drag you to a wedding chapel.""i'd certainly hope not.""so what's wrong with having an innocent dinner and maybe a movie?"casey asked."because that's not fair to him.i'd just be leading him on, and i think we can all agree that he doesn't need that.""exactly," emma agreed.cocking her head, casey eyed megan thoughtfully."deep down, you like him, don't you?"megan rolled her eyes."of course i do.everyone likes him.""no, you really like him.you find yourself thinking about him more than you should.and you're kinda wishing you weren't such a stubborn ass about dating him.because even though you'd kill to know how well he uses his wang, you're even more intrigued about what being loved by him would be like."dumbfounded, megan could only stare at casey.she'd certainly hit the nail on the head about her feelings.finally, she sighed."look, it's a no-win situation.i'm a nursing student.i can't get involved with a physician.it just wouldn't look good on my record.that's just one of the many reasons it wouldn't work between us.""fine.you just keep telling yourself that.""why don't we talk about something else?"megan suggested."who's up for a movie after we hit the mall?"emma asked.megan chewed her lip."oh, i don't know if i should be gone that long.i don't want to take advantage of ankle's kindness for watching mason."emma shook her head."he won't mind.he's happy to do it."as megan raised her brows skeptically, casey snorted."lem me guess, you bribed him sexually to get him to give up a perfectly good saturday watching two kids who are under two."a red flush entered emma's cheeks."i don't know what you're talking about."casey laughed."oh em, you are so busted!"leaning forward, she put her elbows on the table and stared straight at emma."so what was it?green lingerie?a blow job?maybe a b**w j*b while wearing green lingerie?"refusing to meet casey's inquisitive gaze, emma finally murmured, "it was a b**w j*b in the shower this morning, okay?"casey snickered."i knew you had done something.hmm, that was fun.it was like solving a sexual game of clue-it was emma in the shower with a blow job."megan brought her hands up to cover her eyes."umm, hello?that's my uncle you're talking about.""sorry, sorry.i'll refrain from making any more comments about aidan and emma's sex life.""thank you," megan and emma replied in unison."shopping and a movie then?"casey questioned.megan reluctantly agreed."i'll just blame you two if ankle gets all pissy."casey winked."just blame emma.then he can take it out on her later... in the bedroom.""i seriously hate you," emma grumbled.thankfully, the food arrived then and all sex-based conversation was forgotten.at least for the moment.chapter eleven brushing his hand across his sweaty brow, pesh leaned back against the glass door of the trauma area.as the adrenaline began depleting from his system, he needed to prop against something hard for support.regardless of how physically drained he felt, he was emotionally on cloud nine.a beaming smile lit up his face as he stared across the room at the gurney.on it, a young woman was getting acquainted with her newborn son.she had been brought in just twenty minutes before after a car accident sent her into early labor.the paramedics had gotten her through the roughest patches, but thankfully, they had made it to the hospital in time.because her labor was so advanced, they hadn't risked getting her up to the labor and delivery floor.instead, they'd wheeled her in, and pesh had gone to work.it really was an amazing moment considering he'd only delivered three other babies in the history of his medical career.each one was an experience he treasured.the woman glanced up at him and smiled."thank you so much, dr.nadeen.""you're very welcome.they will be taking you up to maternity in just a few minutes."as he stepped out of the room, he found himself ambushed by kara, one of the shift nurses."hey there.how's the good doctor doing today?"the way she spoke was more of a purr, which was a pretty apt summation since she basically acted like she was a cat in heat anytime he was around.he cringed as she ran her hand up his arm."it's fine, thank you.how are you?"he questioned politely."i'm better now that i've seen you," she replied."yes, well, i need to go see about my next case."her heavily painted lips turned down in a pout."aren't you ever going to want to get a drink again?"inwardly, he groaned.in a moment of weakness when he was still reeling after what had happened with megan, he had allowed her to talk him into getting a drink after work.once turned into several times, and then he did the unthinkable.he had made out with her in his car under the faded lights of the bar's neon sign.well, making out didn't quite sum up the fact that she had given him a blow job.although he had vowed to never let anything like that happen again, he found himself walking a fine line around her whenever they were at work."um, sure.maybe.things have been really busy.""i hope that you'll free up some time.i really, really need a night out with you again."reaching around him, kara did the unthinkable.she squeezed one of his ass cheeks.a gasp of shock behind him caused him to whirl around.of all the people in the world that could have been standing there, it had to be megan.pesh quickly jerked out from kara's reach.megan's eyes bulged at the two of them before she quickly looked away.with her head ducked, she started past them.the last thing in the world he needed was for something to be awkward between them.without another word to kara, pesh turned and fell in step beside megan."what are you doing?"she asked.he shrugged."nothing.just walking with you.is that a problem?"glancing over her shoulder at kara, megan said, "it looked like you were a little busy back there."with a grimace, he said, "the conversation and the contact were unwanted by me."megan stared up at him."why am i not surprised by that?"he eyed her curiously."just what do you mean?""you are not the type of man who does public displays of affection... or i should say lust.""haven't we already established that you shouldn't try to typecast me?i don't fit into any of the preconceived holes you have tried to put me in.""there is one hole that you remain firmly lodged in, and that is being a gentleman when it comes to women and sex."as much as he hated to admit it, she had a point about him being a gentleman.he touched her arm, urging her to stop."yes, i am a gentleman both in public and private.but let me address part of your assumption.when i am committed to a woman and she is committed to me, there is never a time i would reject public displays of affection or lust."megan's lips curved up in a smile."so what you're saying is you would actually grab your girlfriend's ass in public?""yes, i would."glancing around, he found them happily out of anyone's earshot."when i am truly committed to a woman, i have trouble keeping my hands off her regardless of where we are.""that's good to know," she replied, with a wink.he couldn't help the silly grin that filled his face as she hurried down the hall to join up with kristi.he was making progress with her, wasn't he?surely megan had to be seeing how much she enjoyed spending time with him in the hospital and would soon decide that she wanted more.his smile started to fade as he wondered if he was deluding himself.with a resigned sigh, he made his way over to the reception bay to sign off on some charts.he eased down on a stool and immersed himself in the paperwork, so he didn't have to think about megan."alpesh!"a voice across the room shouted.he snapped his head up.without even looking over his shoulder, pesh knew who the voice belonged to.few people in his life addressed him by his full name, and no one in the hospital ever called him by his first name.slowly, he rose off his stool and turned around.his youngest brother, dev, stalked toward him with a stormy expression plastered on his face.as the oldest of his three siblings, he had always felt a responsibility to look out for his two brothers and sister.while arjan and shveta had never given him any trouble, dev, as the spoiled baby of the family, had been a challenge for both pesh and his parents.after experiencing teenage rebellion and a wayward early adult life, he had managed to get his wild ways under control when he was twenty-five.dev had set his sights on a beautiful nurse pesh had befriended when he was still a resident.mia martinelli had been through hell with an abusive boyfriend, so pesh was reluctant to pair the two together.but at dev's continued insistence, pesh fixed the two of them up.what followed was a three-year courtship and then engagement.mia was accepted and loved by all of pesh's family.and then dev had gone and thrown it all away by cheating on mia.in her heartbreak, mia had stayed close to pesh, and he wanted her to be happy more than anything else in the world.pesh would have liked to have been surprised by his brother's visit, but ever since he had been summoned to console mia a few days before, he had been anticipating it.truthfully, he had been bracing himself for his brother's wrath."hello dev," he said, in a calm voice.shaking his head furiously, dev said, "i just got a f**king blow off text from mia.when i tried calling her back to demand she explain herself, she couldn't talk because she was in mexico.with aj.""yes, i'm aware of that."dev's dark eyes narrowed at pesh's confirmation."so it's true that you went to talk to her?""yes, it is.""i can't believe it."he threw up his hands in frustration."i didn't want to believe anything mia said, especially that it was you who helped her see that she shouldn't give me a second chance and take me back-that she should make things work with aj.""it's all true.you and i both know mia would never lie.""but how could you?"dev demanded, in a strangled voice."i'm sorry, but i had to do what was best for mia."dev's brows shot up."and what about me?i'm your f**king blood."with a sigh, pesh replied, "i'm sorry, my brother, but blood or not, i couldn't stand by and let you hurt her again-she's been through too much.""i love her!"dev shouted, which caused several of the nurses to spin around in shock."this is not the time nor the place to be having this discussion," pesh growled."i'm not going anywhere, so you better start explaining yourself before i really start a scene."pesh shook his head."fine.you want the truth?here is it.you only think you love mia.you and i both know you can not be faithful to a woman.""i could have for mia.""you already failed her once.she deserved better."dev narrowed his eyes."what, are you f**king her now?"he grimaced at his brother's choice of harsh words."of course i'm not.there's never been anything amorous between mia and myself.thankfully, she's back with the man she loves-the father of her unborn child.""but i need her," dev insisted, his voice taking on a plaintive tone."i'm sorry, but i think it's best if you moved on.most of all, baby brother, i think you need to do a lot of soul searching and maturing before you even think about getting in another relationship."dev's eyes widened."you... You f**king bastard!"he shouted.pesh was debating calling security to remove his unruly brother when he was knocked off his stool by dev's right hook to his jaw.he tumbled backward and crashed onto the floor.before dev could do something like kick him when he was down, megan appeared and wedged herself between them."i think you better leave before i call security," she demanded.pesh struggled to his feet as megan came into dev's line of fire.he couldn't bear if dev hurt her in his anger just because she had taken up for him.dev stared down at megan with a smirk."so my brother needs some pint-sized pu**y defending him now?word to the wise, sweetheart, don't waste your time on him.he's only got a boner for his dead wife."a deep growl erupted in pesh's throat as he lunged for his brother.but he never made it.instead, megan's fist cracked into dev's jaw.the impact didn't take him off his feet, but he did stagger backwards.even as she flailed her wrist back and forth from the obvious pain, megan still managed to bellow, "get the hell out of here.now."dev stared at her in shock as he rubbed his jaw."crazy bitch," he muttered, before stalking off.when megan turned to him, her glowering expression faded to one of concern."you're bleeding!"she cried, rushing for him.his hand came up to grip his cheek.surprise flooded him when he felt wetness.dev must've hit him harder than he thought.he slid his jaw back and forth, causing him to grimace at the popping sound."come here," megan said, grabbing his hand.she started leading him over to one of the examining rooms, but he jerked back."i don't need all this fuss."megan shook her head."we need to get you cleaned up."resignedly, he followed her into the room.for the first time in a long time, he found himself on the opposite line of care.he eased down onto the examining table."really, megan, this isn't necessary."as she busied herself taking out gauze, cotton balls, and antiseptic, she replied, "quit your bitchin'."she glanced over her shoulder at him.at what must have been his incredulous expression at her word choice, she grinned."that's right.just shut up and let me take care of you.""when you put it like that, how can i not?"he teased.her laughter warmed his heart.deep down, he was pleased to find her so attentive to him.she obviously really cared about him if she insisted on cleaning him up.or was she just attentive because she was a great nurse?but then there was the fact she punched dev for insulting him.of course, that was also mortifying.did that mean she questioned his manhood since he didn't go toe-to-toe with his brother?god, what she must think of him now.as he allowed megan to treat his cuts, his thoughts turned to dev's last verbal punch.he grimaced about dev's alluding to the fact he was in love with a ghost.was that what stopped megan from believing his attraction to her?was she really hiding her commitment phobia behind a belief that he was still completely in love with his wife?his feelings gave him away when megan asked, "are you hurting?""no, i'm fine."when she gave him a skeptical look, he replied, "it's more the fact that i'm angry than i am physically hurt.""so what exactly was all that about?"she asked, as she dabbed some antiseptic along his jawline.he winced when the medication hit the broken skin."my brother is angry with me."megan snorted."no shit."she held the cotton ball frozen as she eyed him curiously."what i'm wondering is what got him so fired up that he would stomp into a hospital, call you out, and then punch you?you are the last person on earth i would imagine being in a fight.""the reason is so cliche," he murmured."enlighten me," she urged."he's a petulant child who didn't get his way-he's lashing out at me because he thinks it's all my fault.""i heard the name mia.was it all about a woman?""yes, that's why i called it cliche."he sucked in a harsh breath before filling megan in about what all had transpired between him, dev, and mia."wow," she murmured, when he finished."i suppose that is all one can say about the situation.""you were awfully kind to take care of her like you did-i mean, with both her abusive ex-boyfriend and dev."he shrugged."what else was i supposed to do?i cared for her, and i wanted to see her happy."at the look that flashed in megan's eyes, he quickly added, "there was no amorous love between us.i was happily married at the time, and she desperately needed someone to be strong for her."megan cupped his unhurt cheek in her hand."you really are the most decent man i've ever known.""i don't know about that," he murmured."you truly are."she shook her head."no wonder women are so crazy about you.it's one thing for you to be so good-looking and a smart doctor, but then when you add in the fact of how sweet, caring, and compassionate you are, it's like you're a triple threat."she turned to throw the cotton ball into the trash can.his heartbeat thrummed louder and louder at her words while he sat unblinking and unmoving.part of him wanted to rail at her for not seeing him like all the other women did.if she truly saw what others did, then she would want to date him, wouldn't she?why couldn't she see how good he could be for her?when megan met his tense gaze, she jerked back and momentarily faltered by dropping the piece of gauze in her hand.she quickly deposited the soiled one in the trash and then got another one."so this mia chick, she's run off with some drummer, huh?"she asked, clearly trying to change the subject and lighten the mood in the room."not just any drummer.a famous one at that.""really?what band?"pesh's cocked his head as he tried remembering."something train."megan gasped."not runaway train?"he snapped his fingers."that's it."clapping her hand to her chest, megan's eyes widened."you know someone who knows aj resendiz?"pesh laughed."i suppose i do if you consider that's mia's fiance.""that is so wild.i love that band.""i'll see if i can get you an autograph."with a squeal, megan said, "really?that would be amazing.""anything for the woman who is willing to risk her life for me."megan laughed."it was nothing.""what about your hand?""i'm not going to lie.it hurts.i kinda forgot what punching someone felt like."pesh couldn't help his brows from rising in surprise."have you done a lot of fighting?"she grinned."not exactly mma material, am i?"when he merely shook his head, she replied, "i may have thrown a few punches in my early college partying days when a guy overstepped his bounds."with a smile, pesh said, "good for you.""yeah, my dad was really big on teaching me self-defense moves.you know, with him being ex-military."pesh couldn't help liking megan's strength and spunk.he hadn't known a lot of women like her.in his world, women were bred to be demure and obedient.even though jade wasn't indian, she would've never dreamed of throwing a punch to defend him against dev.but megan, she was so refreshing with her ability to stand up for herself and others-to voice her mind whether it was good or bad."you would have made your father very proud today.""thank you.i'm sure later on today when my knuckles are bruising, he'll want to know why.""i'm very sorry."he took her hand in his before bringing it to his lips."here's a kiss to make any bruises go away."she gave him a teasing smile."is that the best medicine you can do, dr.nadeen?"his mind went wild with illicit images of all the "medicine" and "healing" he could give her.a chaste kiss to alleviate her pain was all he could really offer.his pager went off before he could reply."i better go."he hopped off the table and started for the door.as his hand hovered over the doorknob, there were so many things he wanted to say to her.but finally, he just said, "thanks again for taking care of me.""you're welcome.""and you should probably ice your hand during your break tonight.""yes sir," she replied, with a mock salute.he shook his head at her with a smile before heading out the door.chapter twelve days melted into weeks as megan immersed herself in her clinicals.every day she found a new challenge to conquer.she hadn't imagined how hard it would be, or how exhausted she would be most nights when she crawled into bed.but it was a thrilling exhaustion because she was doing what she felt like she was called to do.each day, she spent more and more time with pesh.she loved working beside him on cases.he had the best bedside manner of all the residents and interns.patients, both young and old, adored him.and the more she was with him, the more megan began to adore him as well.she had just left an examining room where he had charmed a little boy into finally letting them run the tests they needed when kristi beckoned her from down the hall.after hustling to join kristi, megan was quickly ushered inside one of the trauma rooms.immediately, her entire body switched gears as she prepared herself for what she might face."female, thirty, car accident," the paramedic began before rattling off her vitals and other information.after megan had absorbed the information, she turned to the patient."hi, i'm megan.i'm going to get your iv started."the woman gave megan a weak smile."i'm mary.""i guess it would be wrong to say it's nice to meet you, huh?"megan said, trying to talk as normally as she could to put the patient at ease."yeah, i guess so," mary replied.when megan reached for mary's arm to find a place for the needle, mary winced."ouch."as megan surveyed the forearm, she shook her head."looks like you've got a break there.""my arm is broken?"mary asked in a panic."we won't know until we get you into x-ray.i'm going to try this vein here in your wrist."the needle slipped easily into the vein, and megan started the iv.pesh appeared in the doorway then.he smiled at mary on the gurney."hello, mary, i'm dr. Nadeen.i understand you had a little accident today?"she nodded."this car came out of nowhere and hit me head on.""i'm so sorry.why don't we start by you telling me where it hurts?""my chest," she said, with a grimace.pesh pulled back the hospital gown."were you wearing your seat belt?""yes, i always do.""from the dust in your hair, can i assume the airbag deployed?""yeah, it did.""is this where it hurts?"he asked, running his fingers down an angry red whelp.it started at her neck and crossed over her chest.some of it was hidden by the many leads coming from the heart monitor."yeah.""it looks like the seat belt and the airbag did a number on you."mary winced."i thought they were supposed to help you, not hurt you."pesh smiled."trust me.you're much better off with a little burn than if you hadn't been wearing it."after eyeing the monitors mary was hooked up to, he turned to megan."blood pressure is low.let's administer some blood products to raise it."megan nodded.after checking mary's chart for her blood type, she grabbed a bag of blood from the coolers.trading places with pesh, she started another iv in the crook of mary's right elbow."besides your chest, are you hurting anywhere else?"pesh asked, after he finished listening to her heart and lungs."my stomach."megan's breath hitched.it was never good for a car accident patient to have stomach pains.that usually meant hemorrhaging, which could also attribute the low blood pressure.pressing on mary's abdomen, pesh asked, "does this hurt?""no.""here?""no.""what about here?"a screech came from the bed.pesh's brows drew with worry."i'm going to do a quick ultrasound, mary.i want to see what's causing the pain.""okay."megan pulled the machine over to the bedside.she squirted the jelly onto mary's stomach, and then pesh began running the wand over the skin."i'm feeling a little dizzy, too," mary said, in a low voice.pesh and megan exchanged a quick look before he shoved the ultrasound machine back.turning to kristi, he said, "call the or.she's got a ruptured spleen."after depressing the break on the gurney, pesh swung it out of the trauma room and started down the hall."go with him," kristi instructed, as she held onto the phone.megan jogged down the hall to catch up with pesh.he smacked the buttons on the elevator before glancing down at mary."stay with me, okay?we're going to get you into surgery, and then you'll be good as new.""are you sure?"she asked.without hesitation, pesh replied, "yes, but you have to stay with me."the elevator's doors slid open.as megan helped pesh push the gurney inside, mary asked, "did you turn on more lights?"megan creased her brows in worry as she glanced over to pesh."we're getting in the elevator to take you to the or for surgery," she replied."but it's so bright," mary whispered before closing her eyes.her head lolled to the side just as the alarms on the monitors began screeching in megan's ears."dammit, she's crashing!"pesh cried.ice-cold fear pricked its way from the top of megan's head all the way down her body.a patient was crashing in the elevator without the crash cart.what the hell were they supposed to do?"lower the gurney," pesh ordered.megan's jerky hands fumbled with the lever.once it was flat, pesh brought his hands to mary's chest and began compressions.without having to be told, megan leaned down, pinched mary's nose, and began breathing into her mouth.they worked in perfect synchronization."stay with me, mary!"pesh barked, as his hands pumped in a manic pace up and down on mary's chest.glancing up from her breathing, megan eyed the monitors."no pulse."when pesh didn't respond, she continued doing breathing cycles.at the taste of something warm meeting her lips, she jerked back.blood oozed out of mary's mouth."there's more damage than the spleen.she's bleeding from the mouth."pesh didn't even acknowledge her comment."the seat belt and airbag could have caused an aortic tear as well.there's nothing we can do."instead, he kept right on with his compressions.the elevator doors opened, and megan met the expectant faces of the surgical team.when one doctor stepped forward, she shook her head."she's gone."pesh growled across from her."no, she isn't.we have to keep trying.get a cart in here."the doctor eyed the stats on the monitors."i don't think it will help."jerking his head up from mary, pesh snarled, "get the f**king cart!"as one of the nurses scrambled away, two others pulled the gurney from the elevator.megan stood back, feeling helpless as to what to do.once the cart arrived, pesh ripped open mary's gown."charging 260 joules."he rubbed the paddles together."clear!"mary's chest jolted off the gurney with the force of the electricity.megan didn't need to look at the monitors.the heart stayed in a flat line."charging 360 joules."megan closed her eyes when pesh administered the second shock."dammit, jade, don't do this!try for me!"megan couldn't hold back the gasp that escaped her at pesh calling mary by his late wife's name.before pesh could do another charge, one of the surgeon's stepped forward.after he removed his mask, he put his hand on pesh's back."calling time of death."defeated, pesh dropped his head.slowly, he eased back from the gurney.a nurse took the paddles from him and put them back on the cart."i'll go notify the family," pesh murmured.the surgeon shook his head and stared pointedly at megan."get a resident to do that.nadeen, you go take a breather, buddy.""they deserve to speak to the doctor who was with her when she died.""you don't need to do this."pesh slung away from the surgeon and started for the elevator.megan knew there was no point in arguing with him or trying to get one of the residents to take his place.she didn't know if she should try to go to him or not.she regretted her decision when he turned to face her in the elevator.his expression was agonizingly broken.as the doors closed, her heart ached for him.she knew any doctor hated to lose a patient, especially a young one, but this went far deeper than that.from his behavior, megan knew that mary's death had exposed a raw nerve in pesh-one that after two years still hadn't healed.somehow he had seen his wife in mary, and once again, he wasn't able to save her.after she had escorted mary's body back upstairs to wait on the funeral home, megan went in search of pesh.she couldn't find him in any of the exam rooms, nor was he in the doctors' lounge or break room.finally, she went to kristi for answers."did you see where dr. nadeen went?"kristi gave her a sad smile."you'll probably find him on the roof."megan's brows shot up in surprise."the roof?"kristi nodded."whenever he has a really bad day about his wife-" she sucked in a breath when she realized she might have said too much.at the thought of pesh's grief, megan's chest tightened in agony.he was too good of a man to have to suffer like he did."so he goes up to the roof?"megan finished for kristi."he likes to be alone to clear his head.although none of us would say anything, he usually ends up pulling another shift to make up for the time he was gone."of course pesh would do something like that.he was honorable every moment of his life, even after those of immense grief.even though she knew he probably wanted and needed to be alone, megan wanted to check on him.she couldn't bear the thoughts of him suffering so much."um, if it's okay, i think i'll go ahead and take my dinner break."kristi gave her a knowing look before nodding."sure, honey.go right ahead."megan smiled before brushing past kristi.she bypassed the break room where her purse was.instead, she kept going.after a brisk walk down the hall, she got to the authorized personnel only stairwell.she didn't dare use the elevator shaft where trauma patients were brought in from being airlifted.without hesitation, megan swiped her access card.when the lock clicked, she flung the door open and started up the flights of stairs.she was winded when she reached the top.cautiously, her hand hovered over the doorknob.she couldn't help wondering what she might find on the other side.would pesh be an emotional mess?would he be angry that she had interrupted his private grieving?shaking the thoughts from her head, she flung open the door.as she stepped onto the roof, the air grew cooler.a breeze rippled her scrubs.her gaze spun around frantically until she found him.pesh stood at the edge of the roof.his usual ramrod straight posture was slumped, his broad shoulders drawn in.although she couldn't see his face, his gaze seemed fixed straight ahead into the night sky.to add insult to injury, clouds blotted out the stars, cloaking everything in darkness.tentatively, she started over to him."hey," she said softly.he whirled around in surprise.her heart clenched at the sight of the tears sparkling in his eyes.even in the darkness, she could see a blood-red flush entering his cheeks.his hands quickly came up to swipe away the moisture from his eyes."hello," he finally replied in a hoarse whisper.they stood in an awkward silence, staring each other down.finally, megan took a step forward to close the gap between them."how did you know i was up here?"he asked."kristi told me.""hmm."unable to stop herself, she reached out to touch his arm."i'm so sorry, pesh.""it isn't necessary."she shook her head."yes, it is.you're in pain... You've been in pain.i can't help but feel sorry for what you're going through."his usually warm eyes took on a cold look."you were in that elevator, too.you have every right to be emotional.maybe you should be more concerned with why you aren't weeping.""don't," she murmured."don't what?""don't try to mask your pain by being someone you're not or by pointing fingers at others.that isn't you, and you can't fool me."with a ragged sigh, pesh jerked his hand through his dark, wavy hair."i'm sorry.that was completely uncalled for.""it's okay.""no, it's-" she silenced him by bringing her hand up to cover his lips.when she pulled her hand away, he sighed."talk to me," megan pleaded.the clouds above them opened up, causing a slight drizzle to fall."the death of a patient is never easy.any doctor of worth, or nurse for that matter, must possess compassion.then it is inevitable that the same compassion you possess will come back to haunt you-it may even cripple you.when death comes, you can't help feeling for the life that has been lost and for the family members left behind."his voice choked off, and megan drew herself even closer to him.she knew that his last statement held personal meaning for him."what exactly happened to your wife?"she questioned softly.pesh's eyes closed."jade had an undiagnosed clotting condition.she was adopted, so she didn't know anything really about her family history.she'd always been in perfect health-she rarely even went to the doctor with the sniffles.and after we'd been married for three years, we decided it was time to have a baby."when pesh remained silent, megan tentatively asked, "did she die in childbirth?"he shook his head."no, we never got that far.we tried for over a year to get pregnant on our own, and it didn't happen.so we were recommended to a fertility clinic.once the iui process didn't work, we started ivf."a ragged sigh came from deep in his chest."the whole process was physically trying and then emotionally gutting for both of us, but especially for jade."he met her gaze."she blamed herself since the testing revealed that everything was fine with me.although we were labeled as'non-specific infertility,' she felt that it was all her fault.""bless her heart," megan murmured, as her heart went out to a woman she'd never met.getting pregnant had been so easy for her.although mason wasn't necessarily expected, he had never been unwanted in her eyes.but she knew what infertility did to a woman when she saw it ravage her father's sister.although her aunt was now the happy and doting mother of two adopted girls, she knew the emotional toil not getting pregnant had taken.megan, herself, had once been the recipient of her aunt's childless pain when she had announced her pregnancy with mason.still without answers as to how jade had died, megan pressed pesh for more."so what happened with the ivf?""she got pregnant on the first transfer only to miscarry three weeks later.we had just been through another transfer when she died."pesh's adam's apple bobbed up and down as he swallowed hard.megan could only imagine he was trying to keep his emotions in check.finally, he spoke again."she had an embolism most likely brought on by the fertility medication.i was in the kitchen making breakfast when i heard a crash in the bedroom."tears pooled in his eyes."when i called her name and she didn't answer, i ran back to her.she was crumpled on the bedroom floor.after calling 911, i did cpr over and over again, but i could never revive her.""oh pesh," megan murmured.the weight of his pain was so heavy that even she found it hard to breathe.without looking at her, he continued staring straight ahead."from what the medical examiner said, i have some peace in knowing she didn't suffer-that she went quickly without any fear or pain.one minute she was getting ready for work, and the next she was gone.""it's true that there is some peace, especially the fact she didn't know she was going to die.sometimes i can't imagine what it must be like for terminal patients."she shuddered."when you wonder if every day is your last, when you have to think about all you're going to miss.""yes, that is true," he said, in a hushed whisper.when he finally turned to look at her, he gave her a sad smile."it's been two years.every time i think i've moved on, that i've been able to compartmentalize my grief, a case comes through that brings me to my knees.""i'm so sorry," megan murmured, bringing her hand up to cup his cheek.he leaned his face into her hand.his head bowed until their foreheads met."you have to remember that no matter what happened to your wife, and to mary, it wasn't your fault.you weren't responsible.you need to keep living.you're alive."tilting her head up, she gazed into his dark brown eyes."you're alive," she repeated.the rain began to fall harder.her eyelids fluttered to keep the moisture out of her eyes as she gazed up at him.his mouth hovered next to hers, his breath warming her cheek.she could barely breathe in that moment.it was like every molecule in her body was pulsing with need.silently, she pleaded with her eyes for him to kiss her.and then, after what felt like an eternity, he slid his lips over hers.it wasn't the first time she had kissed him-it was just the first time she was sober and had kissed him.now her senses were heightened, and she could experience exactly what she was feeling.his lips were tender and soft at first, and then they switched over to desperate and demanding.it was like he was breathing her in with every brush of his lips and stroke of his tongue as if to prove to himself that he truly was alive.his tongue danced along hers, causing her to moan.he brought his hands up to cup her face while her arms went around his chest, pulling him closer to her.drops of rain pelted her head and ran down her cheeks while pesh's white coat grew moist as she ran her hands up and down his back.she realized, in a dizzying flurry, that no man had ever kissed her like this before.this was like lovemaking with their mouths, and she never wanted it to end.when pesh finally tore his lips from hers, megan's breaths came in heaving pants.her eyes opened to stare up at him.his expression turned from lust to anguish.he shook his head."i'm sorry.""pesh, you don't-" he held up his hand."please, just go."he turned away from her, wrapping his arms around his chest.torn, megan didn't know if she should argue with him and stay or leave."please," he whispered.with her heart still beating wildly from their passionate lip-lock, she turned and fled.as she pounded back down the stairs, her emotions yo-yoed to where she felt like a watch that had been wound too tight.after bursting back through the door, kristi met her in the hallway.her eyes widened at megan's appearance."i, uh, i went outside on my dinner break, and it started raining," megan lied."next time you'll have to remember your umbrella," kristi replied.megan nodded."yeah, i will.""why don't you go to the break room?there's a hair dryer under the sink.when you finish drying off, i could really use you in the supply closet doing inventory.seems like we always almost run out of everything at once.""sure.i can do that."as megan turned to go down the hallway, kristi reached out and grabbed her arm."is he okay?"megan bit down on her lip to keep a hysterical laugh from escaping.was pesh okay?was she okay?who the hell knew?one minute he'd been weeping about his wife and losing a patient, and the next he'd been liquid passion dripping on her lips.regardless of his emotional whiplash, she'd experienced the same.she now found herself wanting more of his kisses when she shouldn't.but it wasn't just the kiss she wanted-she wanted all of him and not just for sex."no, he's not.i guess he's just trying to accept the loss, both past and present, as best he can," she finally replied.kristi nodded in acknowledgement.when megan felt she was free from any more questioning, she hurried down the hall to the break room.thankfully, she found it empty.after grabbing a brush from her purse, she went to the sink to grab the hair dryer.gazing at her reflection in the mirror, she looked a bedraggled mess.she was practically washed out except for her lips.they were swollen and bright red from pesh's kisses.her finger came up to trace her bottom lip.as memories of his kisses filled her mind, she tried desperately to think of anything else.in the end, she had gone up to the roof to somehow save pesh, and instead, she had lost herself to him and his emotions.chapter thirteen pesh regretfully watched megan's retreating form.he cursed under his breath as she disappeared into the stairwell.what was his problem?the woman had been merely comforting him, and he had allowed his libido to take over.he had promised her he would keep his distance.regardless of the flirting and easy banter between them, he had kept things professional.now she probably felt trapped and harassed by him.she tried to talk to him about it, and he'd dismissed her.he paced around the rooftop as the rain that had soaked him to the bone began to dissipate.his mind was a jangled mess of thoughts and emotions.one voice argued over and over that megan had wanted him to kiss her-that the look in her eyes told the truth.but pesh worried that in his agony he had misread the signals she may or may not have been giving.in the end, he'd made a terrible situation even worse by not being able to control his feelings for megan.with a frustrated grunt, he realized he had to make things right with her.he needed to apologize.casting one last look out over the horizon, he then turned and started for the stairwell.after pounding downstairs, he searched the hallway for any signs of megan.when he spotted kristi, he was surprised not to see megan with her."where's megan?"he asked."oh, since we're kinda slow tonight, i asked her to go work in the storage closet.we're behind on inventory and cataloguing.""i see."kristi eyed him up and down before shaking her head."you're drenched.""it's raining outside.""so i've heard," she said knowingly."what does that mean?"he asked.she waved her hand."nothing.why don't you do us both a favor and go get out of those wet clothes?the last thing we need is you coming down with something."pesh knew it was fruitless to argue with her.instead, he tucked his tail between his legs and made his way to the doctors' lounge.he took a clean pair of pants and shirt out of his locker.after he slid on a new white coat, he strode down the hall to the medicine closet.after swiping his key card, he entered the room.when he closed the door behind him, megan turned around, gazing expectantly at him.now that he was in front of her, he didn't know exactly what to say.he had been on an emotional overload on the roof, and things had escalated far too quickly."look, i just want to say how very sorry i am about kissing you.""well i'm not," she replied matter-of-factly.pesh's neck snapped back in shock.her response wasn't what he was expecting at all.he had imagined she might be relieved or even embarrassed, but he hadn't imagined that she would be unregretful.he cleared his throat."regardless, i shouldn't have done it.i was in an emotionally vulnerable position, and you were merely trying to comfort me.nothing more."his words were more for his own good than hers.she shook her head."just because i was comforting you, doesn't mean i didn't want you to kiss me.that i still don't want to kiss you again."his brows furrowed in confusion."but you-" "pesh, i've wanted you since the night of noah's baptism.but you shot me down then, and you still do."although his heart wanted to soar at her admission of wanting him, the reality of her words caused his chest to clench instead."sexually.you only want me sexually.""yes."he should have been flattered that a young, sexy woman like megan desired him.but he wasn't.half of the women in the hospital would be willing for him to drag them to an empty patient's room for a quick and dirty screw.but that's not who he was.he had never been that way with women, and he didn't see how it could be possible to change.all he wanted was for her to really see him and how good he could be for her.how good they would be for each other.he thought that was what she was feeling in the moments before and after he kissed her.but now it seemed it was once again only lust.although it was probably pointless, he couldn't help putting everything out there once again."but when we were up on the roof, there wasn't a moment where you wanted more from me than just sex?"he licked his lips and took a step toward her."just a second where you could imagine your life with me in it?"megan stared at him, her expression contemplative.for a brief moment, pesh thought by her hesitation that she had changed her mind about him.but then she shook her head."how many times are you going to make me hurt you with this?you're too good for me, pesh.we both know that.i'll remind you again of some of the reasons i'm not the one for you.i'm twenty-five, and you're thirty-seven.you want a wife, and i'm not ready to be married."her words cut into his chest the same as if she had taken a sharp blade to him.she may have had to repeat herself this time, but he realized the finality of her words.and then an idea hit him so hard that he shuddered-a true light bulb moment and epiphany.there was only one way he was going to get to have his sweet megan, and that was if he gave in to her.he would have to become someone else for her, even if it was just for a little while.he could distract her with sex that she both desired and demanded, but at the same time, he would make her fall in love with him.it could work.it had to.cocking his head at her, he questioned, "so let me get this straight once and for all.you would let me..." he paused, fighting the conflict within himself to say what he needed to.he drew in a ragged breath."you would let me f**k you but not love you?"her eyes widened at his word choice."what's gotten into you?"he shrugged nonchalantly, feeling slightly empowered in the dr. Jekyll and mr. hyde moment."i merely asked a simple question."she snorted exasperatedly."yeah, about..." she swallowed hard."fucking, of all things.""yes."megan shook her head wildly back and forth."i can barely acknowledge hearing you say the word, least of all you doing that.""you can't imagine me-" she held up her hand."you're not the type of man to f**k," she countered.crossing his arms over his chest, he countered, "oh really?i'm too nice of a guy?""something like that.""i am a man, megan.we all have needs.isn't f**king one of them?"her body trembled slightly at his words.she licked her lips before replying, "s-stop saying that word-it isn't you.""so, f**king isn't me?don't tell me you think i'm totally asexual-that you can't imagine me f**king a woman... Fucking you."he eased in closer to her."we both know for a fact that you wanted nothing more than to f**k me the night of noah's baptism.given the chance right now, you'd let me strip off your scrubs and f**k you up against the medicine cabinet."as her chest heaved up and down, she took a step back from him, bumping against the counter."but you don't say things like that.you're refined.you're a gentleman," she whispered."it may have been a while, but even a gentleman like me enjoys f**king."he closed the gap between them."what are you doing?"she whispered."i'm giving you what you want.""you're giving in?""yeah, why not?"as he dipped his head, his mouth hovered over hers."if you really want me to take you, then kiss me."without a moment's hesitation, megan crashed her lips against his.the kiss was hard and desperately seeking more.as his tongue thrust into her mouth, his hand came to her breast.tenderly, he cupped the flesh, feeling the weight fill his hand.unsatisfied with the lack of contact, he pulled his hand away and slid it underneath megan's top.over her bra, he kneaded her breast again, feeling her nipple harden under his touch.he felt his erection grow at the sound of her whimper.he wanted nothing more than to strip off all her clothes and kiss every inch of her body.megan's mouth popped off of his, and she stared up at him with hooded eyes."what about someone finding us?""i'll lock the door," he replied.reluctantly, he pulled away from her to walk back over to the door.after he turned the lock, he made sure to push a box in front of it as well.they would have enough warning if someone were to try to use their card to come in.with his hands on her shoulders, he steered her behind one of the floor-to-ceiling shelves, concealing them even further from potential prying eyes."now where were we?"he asked, with a smile.she grinned and wrapped her arms around his neck."i think you were getting acquainted with second base.""yes, i remember now."instead of his hands going back to her br**sts, he pulled her flush against him.as his lips met hers, he slipped his arms around her waist.he grabbed the globes of her ass and squeezed, causing megan to moan into his mouth.his hands gripped her flesh, urging her upward.rising on her tiptoes, she allowed him to hoist her up.her legs wrapped around his waist.once he had secured her to him, he rammed them back, until they bumped into the wall.he ground his pelvis into her core, letting her feel how much he truly wanted her."mmm," she murmured, as he continued rubbing against her.one of her hands abandoned his shoulder and slid down his back to squeeze his ass.his fingers jerked her hair back, pulling her lips back from his.he gazed into her heavy lidded eyes before his mouth dipped to her neck.his tongue slid up her jugular, feeling her racing pulse."so you'll let me inside your body but not your heart?"he demanded."yes.please pesh."now that he had her right where he wanted her, it was time to put his plan into motion."if i give you an orgasm, you'll have to go on a date with me."her eyes widened through her panting."you can't be serious.""oh, but i am.give and take, megan.i give you what you want-" he paused in his thrusts to let his fingers dip into the waist band of her scrubs.through the thin scrap of her thong, his hand caressed her, causing her to whimper."which is to explode in bliss."as he continued stroking her, she hissed in a breath as she glared at him."you want me pretty bad, don't you, megan?"he asked, as his fingertips felt of her growing moisture.her fingernails dug into his shoulders."yes.god, yes, i do.""so let me give you this pleasure.i want nothing more than to see you come apart."he licked his lips."then you'll let me take you out."her eyelids fluttered, and she bit down on her lip.he could tell she was internally raging war with herself about what to do.as his fingers sped up their tempo against her clit, her head fell back against the wall."you don't play fair," she groaned.he momentarily eased his hand off of her."i don't want to play games with you at all, but you leave me no choice."he lowered his head to kiss her again."all i want is you," he murmured."fine, fine.""fine what?"he questioned, as he looked her in the eye."make me come, and i'll go out on a date with you."he smiled before easing her back onto her feet.when he sank to his knees before her, megan's brows furrowed in confusion.he then gripped the waistband of her scrubs.he eased them down, along with her panties, never taking his eyes off hers.when he had them down to her ankles, he rose back up.grabbing her by the waist, he shifted her to the side where she bumped into the counter.he gripped her h*ps once again and raised her up to where her butt rested on the cool formica.he slid her pants and thong over her shoes, letting the drop into floor below him.he was so far gone with desire that he didn't stop to think how long it had been since he had gone down on a woman.he pushed the voices out of his head when they reminded him of how jade had teasingly called his tongue a master of orgasms.instead, he focused on the beautiful, panting woman before him as she widened her legs invitingly for him.when he slid his tongue slowly up megan's wet slit, they both shuddered.he took one of her legs and propped her foot on his shoulder, so he could get better access to her while he pushed her other thigh further open.her pink, glistening center was laid out beautifully before him.as his tongue flicked and teased her swollen clit, megan threw her head back and moaned.his lips closed over her clit, sucking it hard.her h*ps began to rock back and forth.he knew it wasn't going to take him long to make her come-she was too ready for this.it had been a long time for her as well.he resisted using his fingers.instead, he spread her apart and then thrust his tongue rhythmically inside her.megan's cries grew louder to where he brought his hand up and clamped it over her lips.the last thing they needed was someone banging on the door.as he felt her walls tensing, she reached out to twist her fingers in his hair.he welcomed the pain as she went over the edge, convulsing and screaming against his hand.when megan's walls finishing clenching and pulsing, pesh removed his tongue from inside her.he placed butterfly kisses against her core and then on the insides of her thighs.when he finally glanced up, he found megan staring at him, a combustive mix of emotions swirling in her blue eyes."that was..." smiling, he rose up from the floor.his hands gently came to her waist.he was just about to pull her down when she stopped him."don't.i can't even feel my legs right now."he brushed her hair back from her face."it has been a long time, hasn't it?"she shook her head."how about never has it been like that."he couldn't help staring at her incredulously."what do you mean?""i mean, that i've never gotten off like that."she gave him a sheepish grin."at least not with a man."at her insinuation, he felt warmth enter his face."are you blushing about me mentioning masturbating?""no, i'm not," he protested feebly.megan laughed."you really are something else, you know that?""i am?""hell yes.one minute you've got your tongue buried inside me, giving me the most intense orgasm of my life, and then the next you're blushing.it's like you became another person a few minutes ago.you were forceful and domineering."a shudder rippled through her as she raised her brows."do you always get like that when it comes to sex?"pesh felt even more warmth creeping into his cheeks.how she could talk so frankly without any pants on, he had no idea."we should cover you up.""you were enjoying the view a few minutes ago."she leaned over and winked at him."a very up-close and personal view."he rubbed his hands over his face."honestly, i don't know what came over me.i came in here to tell you i was sorry and that you wouldn't have to worry about me coming on to you again."and then all hell had broken loose.it was like he had been fried with the electrical current from the paddles on the crash cart.he'd decided to become another person to win her and damned if he had.almost too easily for his liking.what had he said to her in the heat of the moment?he stared intently at her."all i could think of was how much i wanted you and what it would take to have you.""you really wanted me that much?"she asked, her brows rising in surprise."yes, i did."with a coy smile, she scooted to the edge of the counter.she wrapped her legs around his waist and drew him closer to her."what about you?"she asked, as her hand cupped his erection through his pants.his h*ps bucked involuntarily, and he closed his eyes, trying to steady himself."this wasn't about me," he murmured."i can't let you go back on the floor with a hard-on."she licked up the side of his face, causing him to shudder."i owe you at least a happy ending after those multiple orgasms you just gave me."his closed eyes popped open."multiple did you say?"she giggled."yeah.""then that means you owe me multiple dates, right?"megan reached around to smack his ass."you're a bad boy trying to trick me.""i'm sorry.i play dirty when i have to."without another word, megan unbuttoned and unzipped him.she eased his pants and boxer shorts off his hips.when his erection was freed, she glanced between them."hmm, pretty impressive."he started to laugh at her remark, but when she gripped him in her hand, he gasped.all coherent thoughts flew out of his mind as she stroked his length up and down, alternating from smooth slides to hard tugs."would you rather it was my mouth on you than my hand?"she asked."feels good no matter what," he muttered, his head dipping to rest against her shoulder.her breath scorched against his ear."mmm, i love that you're so hard.just for me, right?""yes," he panted."just for you.only you."flicking her tongue out, she encircled his lobe and the shell of his ear."can you imagine what it would be like to bury yourself deep inside me?"her words were having too much of an effect on him.the dirty talk, coupled with the way she had her hand on him, caused him to tighten up.he tried to pull away, but she kept hold of him.and then he was coming undone.when he finally came back to himself, he opened his eyes to see that he'd come on megan's exposed thighs."i'm sorry," he said."it's okay.it was worth it to see your o face."she smiled dreamily at him."god, you were beautiful."since he'd never had a woman tell him that, he couldn't help flushing.he pulled away from her to search for something to clean her up with.finally, he found a roll of paper towels.when he returned to her, he gently wiped himself off her skin.after he finished, he helped her down off the counter."i'll go out first.i need to clean up.and so do you."he gave a brief nod.he was having trouble processing all the emotions swirling through his mind."so when it is?"she asked."when is what?"he asked dumbly.he was still far too obliterated by a simple hand job to be processing coherent thoughts."our date."he had almost forgotten what he asked of her.out of the heat of the moment, he felt guilty for what he had done.he shook his head."no, i wasn't being fair.you don't owe me a date.""yes, i do.i always keep my promises.""you're really going to go out with me?"she grinned."of course i am."his heartbeat sped up."are you off this saturday?""yes.""you don't have plans?""no, i don't.""and you can get someone to watch your son?""yessss," she replied, with a smile."okay, then let's do it saturday.""do what exactly?""the date."she laughed."yes, but what are we doing?""it's a surprise."tilting her head, she eyed him suspiciously."i'm not sure i like the sound of that.""i promise you'll like it.""what should i wear for this surprise date?"already the wheels had been turning in his head.since it might be his only chance, he knew he wanted to make the date as special as he could."wear something dressy.we might be going somewhere that requires more formal wear than jeans.""okay, i think i can do that."at the sound of his pager, he grimaced."guess i'll be the one leaving first."without hesitating, he bowed his head to kiss her.just like before, the feel of her mouth against his lit him on fire.reluctantly, he pulled away."go wash up first."her breath warmed his cheek before she glanced up into his eyes."i can taste myself on you."he closed his eyes as a shudder went through his body."you're trying to kill me."she flashed him a wicked grin."sorry.it's the truth.""behave yourself," he replied, before he headed to the door.chapter fourteen with less than ten minutes before pesh was set to arrive for their date, megan found herself a neurotic mess still holed in the bathroom.she'd changed outfits at least three times before deciding on a black and white lace dress that came just to her knees.it had actually come out of the back of her closet-one of the tamer remnants of her wilder days.pesh had told her to wear something dressy, and it did fall into the dressy category, although it was probably a little sexier than she would have liked.while she'd pulled her long hair back into a loose knot at the back of her neck, she was now rethinking her strategy.if she'd left her hair down, it would cover more of the exposed skin that the spaghetti straps and neck of the dress showed.glancing at her phone one more time, she cringed."fuck it," she muttered, before spritzing on some perfume.after the fragrant cloud faded, she headed out of the bathroom.she grabbed her purse and headed upstairs.when she came into the kitchen, a loud, cat-calling whistle pierced her ear.she scowled at sean."seriously?"he shrugged."you look hot, sis."gavin, who stood beside sean at the counter, nodded."we never see you in anything but scrubs."megan couldn't help smiling at her brothers."thank you."wagging his brows, gavin asked, "got a hot date, huh?""not exactly," she replied, as she went to grab her purse."yeah right," he mumbled under his breath.after slinging her purse on her shoulder, she whirled around to pin him with her stare."and what's that supposed to mean?""it means that chicks don't get dressed up like that for nothing.you obviously want to impress this guy.so, it's obviously a hot date.""since when did you become the love guru?"she questioned.sean grinned as he elbowed gavin."she's getting riled, man.being irrational about little things usually means love."megan opened her mouth to lay into her brothers, but then found herself speechless, so she closed it back up.without another word to her brothers, she went into the living room.she found her dad lounging in his chair with mason snuggled to his side.when her dad looked up, he did a double take."don't you look beautiful, sweetheart," he said.she bent down and kissed his cheek."thanks, daddy."mason tore his gaze away from the television to look at her."mommy, bye-bye?"this was one question she hadn't anticipated explaining."yes, mommy is going to go see a friend today, and you're going to stay here with grammy and granddad."his tiny brows furrowed."mace no go?"guilt rocketed through her.how could she spend one of her few off days away from her son?the doorbell rang, and she was forced out of her self-loathing to answer the door.taking a deep breath, she opened it.her heart did a funny little flip-flop at the sight of pesh on the porch.it wasn't just how handsome he looked in his khaki pants, red button-down polo shirt, and black blazer.it was also the fact he held a dozen red roses in his hand."hi," she said shyly, after they had stared at each other for a few seconds.he smiled."hello.""would you like to come in?"as he nodded, she stepped aside to give him room to come in the door.he turned back to her and held out the roses."these are for you."after the words left his lips, he grimaced, as if what he had said offended him."they're beautiful.thank you.""bye-bye kiss, mommy!"mason called from the living room.she smiled apologetically at pesh."i'm sorry.i'll just be one minute.""take your time."she hurried across the foyer and into the living room.she deposited the roses onto one of the tables."i'll be back tonight.you be a good boy, okay?"she said, when she got to her father's chair.she leaned over and kissed both of mason's cheeks."give mommy a kiss."he gave her a smacking kiss on the cheek."bye, my love," megan said, before turning and heading out of the room.she'd just reached pesh's side when he glanced past her."what?"she asked."i think we have a potential stowaway," he replied, with a smile.she whirled around to see mason standing in the foyer."what's wrong, baby?""no go," he whimpered.she glanced up at pesh."i'm sorry.he usually is fine about me leaving him."she knelt down beside mason."i won't be gone long, and you'll have much more fun here with grammy and granddad.pesh and i are doing boring, big people stuff.""no go!"he cried, as big tears pooled in his eyes.pesh knelt down beside her."hey buddy, don't cry.i'm not going to take your mommy away from you.""mace go?"he asked hopefully.megan shook her head."no, sweetheart, i told you that we were going to do big people things today.""that's true," pesh said.then he smiled at mason."but that doesn't mean we can't take a little detour first."megan's widened her eyes in surprise."what do you mean?""why don't we take mason to lunch at his favorite place?""you don't mean that," megan argued.pesh cut his gaze over to her."sure, i do.i can adjust our reservations."she couldn't help staring at him in shock.how was it possible he was so willing to change his plans simply because mason didn't want her to leave?she fought the urge to reach out and touch his shoulder to make sure he was real-he was far too good to be true at times."is that okay with you?"pesh asked her."of course it's all right with me.i was worried about it not being okay with you.""i wouldn't have suggested it if i didn't mean it."he reached out and ruffled mason's hair."all right, buddy, where do you want to go for lunch?""cheese!cheese!"he cried, as he bobbed up and down.megan groaned as pesh's expression grew confused."he wants to eat cheese?"he asked."no, he wants to go to chuck e. Cheese-every parent's worst nightmare."pesh chuckled as he rose up from the floor."all right then.chuck e. Cheese it is.""go get your shoes," megan instructed.as mason raced back into the living room, megan stood up."you really don't have to do this.""honestly, i don't mind.we can go have lunch with mason, and then we can start our date.i'm sure he'll be worn out and ready for a nap when we get back, right?""yes, he will.""good.then he won't have any reason to miss you if he's asleep."she smiled at his thoughtfulness."thank you.i really mean that.""you're welcome."he reached out and brushed her cheek.when he started to lean in to kiss her, mason ran back into the foyer with his shoes.pesh quickly jerked back.to combat the awkwardness, megan busied herself with getting mason's shoes on.when she finished, mason bounded over to pesh and grabbed his hand."go!go!"pesh laughed at mason's enthusiasm.he held his other hand out for megan.she slid her hand into his and then they started to the car.as megan walked through the doors of their local chuck e. Cheese, she recoiled slightly at both the ear- splintering noise and the stomach-turning smells.she also fought her embarrassment at the looks she and pesh were getting for their more formal outfits."i think we're a little overdressed," she said.he held up his index finger and thumb before pinching them close together."just a little bit."tugging on pesh's hand, mason dragged him over to the toddler area of games.megan quickly dug in her purse for some money for tickets.after she bought them, she went over to pesh."i'll go grab us some pizza."she waved the tickets at him."once these are gone, he's done.""i don't mind getting him more."she shook her head."trust me.he's done.""okay then," he replied good-naturedly.megan felt completely at ease leaving pesh to watch mason.she got them a couple of slices of mason's favorite, pepperoni, along with some drinks and then made her way over to a table close to the toddler area.when she caught pesh's eye, she waved them over.after several tense moments, he was finally able to convince mason to leave the play area to come and eat.as mason bounced around in his seat, megan knew she would be doing good to get four bites of pizza down him before he was raring to go play again.she also had a fear that she, pesh, or the both of them were going to be wearing tomato sauce before it was all said and done."this place is very interesting," pesh remarked, as he gazed around.megan laughed."have you never had the pleasure?""sadly no.my brother, arjan's, and his children live in florida, so i've really never had a reason to come.""you've dodged a bullet there.that's for sure."he smiled before taking a bite of his pizza.his expression turned so sour that megan couldn't help giggling."this is terrible," he muttered."i should have warned you not to bother eating.it only seems appetizing to small children who are hyped up on adrenaline."he took a long swig from his coke and swished the liquid around like he was trying to rid himself of the taste.when he caught mason looking at him, he put on a fake smile."mmm, that's good pizza.you better eat yours before i do.""nice save," she murmured.he winked at her as he threw his napkin on his plate.she couldn't believe when her heart fluttered at his gesture.it was almost impossible to believe that she could be getting feelings for him in the middle of chuck e. cheese."done.go play," mason announced, bringing her out of her thoughts.she shook her head."i don't think so.you need to eat more."mason scowled at her before grabbing another bite and shoveling it into his mouth.he managed to clean his plate with a little coaxing from pesh.then the two of them went back over to the play area.as megan watched them, the small ache in her chest began to grow.pesh was completely hands on, hoisting mason up where he could reach things and then catching him when he came off the slide.he seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with mason.some guys would have played with mason only to get on her good side.but pesh didn't have an agenda when it came to her, unless it was to have her embrace the idea of a relationship with him.when the last ticket was spent, she rose off her chair."okay, time to go."mason's face scrunched up, and he looked like at any minute he might throw a tantrum to stay.but pesh took his hand."we'll come back another time."his reply seemed to pacify mason, and he happily slung his and pesh's arm back and forth as they walked to the car.when they got buckled up, megan turned back to mason."what do you say to pesh for bringing you?""tank you, esh," mason said.his words sent a broad grin stretching across pesh's face."you're welcome, buddy.i had a good time."when he glanced over at megan, she gave him a genuine smile."i had a good time, too."taking one of his hands off the steering wheel, he reached over to take her hand in his.while the gesture was a little too lovey-dovey for her liking, she didn't argue with him.instead, she just enjoyed his touch.once they had deposited a sleepy mason back home at megan's, they abandoned her suv and gotten into pesh's jaguar."so where exactly are we going?"megan asked, as she buckled her seat belt."it's a surprise.""seriously?you're still playing coy about it?""for just a little while longer."she shifted in her seat where she could look at him better."can i try to guess?""i suppose.i'm not sure i'd tell you even if you guess," he teased."are we going to atlanta?"he cut his gaze from the road over to her."have patience."crossing her arms over her chest, she huffed, "i don't have patience for games.""okay, i'll give you a little hint.actually, it's more of a question than it is a hint.""yeah?""do you have a fear of heights?"she snorted."no, i don't.why?"he gave her a sly grin."i told you.it's a hint.""i went skydiving when i turned twenty-one, so i'm totally fine with heights.of course, i seriously doubt we're going sky diving in these clothes.""no, we're not."she wrinkled her nose."please tell me it's not box seats at the opera or something like that."his face fell."you don't like the opera?""never been and never want to."pesh appeared almost personally insulted."i'm going to have to change your mind on that one.""why am i not surprised you like opera?""don't knock it until you've tried it.""a bunch of screeching men and women singing in a language i don't understand?not my idea of a good time.""but there is such love and passion in their delivery," he argued."um, i'm just going to have to agree to disagree with you.""for now at least," he said, with a wink.when the car started slowing down, megan peered out the windshield before turning to pesh."we're at mccollum?""yes.""you're taking me flying?"he smiled."yes, i am."even though she had known he had a plane from how he'd helped get aidan to noah's delivery, she couldn't believe their date included something as unique as flying."so let me get this straight.i'm dressed like this," she did a little hand motion over her dress, "to go flying?"an amused look twinkled in his dark eyes."you have absolutely no patience, do you?""no, i don't."as he put the car in park outside the hanger, he turned to her."by your lack of being able to withhold gratification, i'm assuming you've never partaken in any tantric sex?"she couldn't stop her mouth from dropping to her chest."w-what?"she stammered.turning in his seat, he pinned her with a hard stare."have i managed to shock you again?"unable to speak, she merely bobbed her head.pesh only chuckled at her response."come on.let's get going."still in shock, she remained rooted to her seat.when he came around to open her door, she peered up at him."tantric sex?like sting, trudie styler, and tantric sex?""yes, i suppose so," he replied, as he offered her his hand.ordinarily, she wouldn't have taken it, but at the declaration that pesh was actually into something outside the sexual norms, she was too floored to argue with him."i didn't think you'd like anything... Kinky."pesh's dark eyes widened."tantric isn't kinky.it's about connecting with your lover on a more intimate level.it's about breathing them in and truly being one.""so it's not about marathon sex that lasts for days?"he chuckled."you've gotten the more salacious side confused with what it actually is."megan pursed her lips at him as her mind whirled with the possibilities.after all, if tantric sex with pesh was anywhere as good as his efforts in going down on her, she was one very lucky lady."i guess you'll just have to educate me."they were interrupted by an air traffic controller with a headset."hey, dr. Nadeen, how goes it?""good.thank you.everything ready to go, lewis?"pesh asked, as he pumped the man's hand."gassed up and checked out.we just need your flight plan."pesh's gaze went to megan before he said, "we'll be flying into savannah/hilton head airport.""great.thanks," lewis replied, before he started back inside the hanger."you're taking me to savannah?"she asked."for dinner and dancing.i had originally intended on more, but we got a later start.""this is crazy.you're crazy."he gave her a puzzled look."you don't like savannah?""no, i love it.i just meant taking me four hours away for dinner.""it's not that long by plane."crossing her arms over her chest, she tilted her head at him."you couldn't just take me somewhere fancy in atlanta?you have to fly me in your private plane to another city?"he shrugged."why not?"although it was probably unattractive, she couldn't help snorting with contempt."i'm probably going to sound a little like the line from pretty woman when she says she appreciates the seduction scene, but she's a sure thing."she patted her chest."i am a sure thing.you don't have to go to all this trouble."his dark eyes narrowed."your way of thinking is precisely why i'm doing what i am.""what do you mean?""you've only been with men who wanted a sure thing-men who didn't even bother trying to imagine a future with you past when they came at the end of the night."she sucked in a breath at his words.with his expression softening, he closed the gap between them."while you may only want sex from me, i want far more from you.i want your time, but i also want you to understand that you're worthy of something special.and if it takes planes and fancy meals to prove it to you, then i'm going to do it."after his argument, megan sat frozen in dumbfounded silence.how was it possible that he knew so much about her?he was right in the fact that she settled for being the'sure thing' for the guys she dated in the past.she knew she didn't want to make those mistakes again, so why shouldn't she let him try to wine and dine her?"fine.take me to savannah."he opened the passenger side door."here you go.make sure you buckle your seat belt."she nodded before she dipped inside the plane.pesh waited for her to adjust her dress before he closed the door.as he walked around the front of the plane, she got busy finding the seat belt and buckling up.once he climbed inside, he handed her a headset."this will help with the cabin noise.""it's going to mess my hair up," she complained.he laughed."i never took you as the type of woman who worried about her hair."she grinned as she eased the headset on."now you know.i worry about my hair, and you get your freak on in the bedroom."he rolled his eyes at her and turned in his seat.after placing his headset on, he started flipping switches and turning knobs.the propeller on the front of the plane started whirling."so what kind of plane is this?"she asked over the noise.holding up a finger, he spoke into the mic on the headset."ground to tower, this is cessna 172 requesting to taxi for takeoff."suddenly the sound of the tower came over her headset."clearance for taxi and takeoff, cessna 172.""roger that," pesh replied.the plane lurched forward and then started taxing down the runaway."hmm, i'm guessing a cessna 172?"pesh smiled."yes, it is.""it's nice.i like it.""i hope you'll be saying that again in a minute."megan knew what he meant when the plane started gaining speed down the runaway.just like when she was on a commercial flight, it was on the ground one minute, and then in the air the next.they soared into the blue sky while zipping through white, fluffy clouds.once they had gained enough altitude, pesh eased off on the rudder and glanced over at her."you okay over there?"she grinned."are you kidding me?this is amazing.""i'm glad to hear you like it.i didn't know if you were going to take after your uncle aidan.""i hear you gave him drugs to make it."pesh laughed."yeah, i did.he slept most of the way there.""total wuss," she remarked with a smile.after adjusting one of the controls, pesh said, "well, i have to admit that my late wife wasn't a fan, either.she tolerated flying with me because she knew how much i loved it, but most of the time, she'd take a pill to relax.""so she didn't share your passion?""no, she didn't.she always encouraged me to do what i loved.she never was one to make me choose between her or something else.she was that sacrificing.""that was really amazing of her to be that giving."when pesh remained silent, megan knew it was time for a conversation change."now that i know we're going to savannah, are you going to tell me where we're going for dinner?"he smiled."it'll probably be a late lunch when we get there.""so, where will our late lunch be?""do you like the historic district?""i love it.""good.i've picked a restaurant there for us.""do you come to savannah often?""a couple of times a year, mainly for medical conferences on the coast.""and you always fly?""i do," he replied, with a smile.the flight took less time than she thought, and with clear weather, it was totally smooth.as they started making their descent, pesh glanced over at her."are you ready for the landing?""sure.why wouldn't i be?""it can be a little intense for some people.you see a lot more of the ground rushing at you than when you're in a 747."she cocked her head at him."i went skydiving, remember?""ah, that's right."with a wink, he added, "you're my little adrenaline junkie."megan laughed."i was.not anymore.""what changed all that?""mason.when you're responsible for the health, safety, and happiness of someone else, your entire perspective changes.""he's a true gift."she jerked her gaze to him."yes, he is."pesh gave her a small smile before radioing the tower.once he had clearance to land, they started rapidly losing altitude.the runway got closer and closer until the plane jolted forward and then began skidding along the pavement.when it finally came to a shuddering stop, megan exhaled the breath she'd been holding."still okay?"pesh asked.she grinned."never better."the sound of the tower came in her headset as pesh listened to the instructions.the plane started rolling toward one of the hangers.once he had parked and powered down the plane, he got out to help her.after a quick talk with a member of the grounds crew, pesh took her hand and led her out of the hanger.a cab waited to take them into the city.she laughed as she slid across the seat."what?"pesh asked."i'm surprised by the cab.i thought you might really go upscale by having a limo or chauffeur-driven car pick us up.""i like to stay humble," he replied with a wink.she shook her head at him before turning to gaze out the window at the scenery.when they began winding through the antebellum homes of the historic district, megan felt her stomach growl.she'd been too nervous to eat breakfast, and then she hadn't dared eat at chuck e. cheese's.the cab stopped outside a chic looking restaurant.as pesh paid the driver, megan hopped out and took in the sights around her.she loved the old world feel of the city with all its history and charm.pesh offered her his arm, and then they walked inside.the restaurant's popularity was evident in how crowded it was even at four in the afternoon.they were ushered to a quiet, candlelit table."wine?"pesh asked."yes please.""white okay?""sure."after the waiter left with their drink order, megan surveyed the menu and sighed."everything looks so good."glancing over his menu at her, pesh said, "with the cuisine being southern, i imagined you would like it.""i love all types of food.trust me, as hungry as i am now, i would have eaten anywhere."the waiter returned with their wine, and megan knew she needed to make a decision."i'll have the shrimp and grits, please.""very good, ma'am," the waiter replied."i'll have the same," pesh said, handing the waiter his menu.when megan grinned at him, his brows rose."what?""i'm just surprised to hear you eating something so southern as shrimp and grits."he tsked at her."when will you learn that you can never pigeonhole me as one thing or the other?"she laughed."actually, i like that you're proving me wrong and being unexpected.""really?"she nodded."sometimes i feel like people try to do the same thing to me.people have their own assumptions about girls or women who get knocked up.i hope i constantly prove them wrong.""i'm sure you do."after taking a sip of his wine, he cocked his head at her."prove me wrong on this one.does a southern girl like you eat indian food?""oh yes, i love it."his dark eyes lit up."what's your favorite dish?""hmm, i love butter chicken, but i'm also a fan of pav bahaji.""i'm impressed.emma had never eaten any indian food, and i don't think i made a good impression on her."pesh's chuckle died out, and he immediately grimaced at the mention of emma's name.knowing that they were dancing around the white elephant in the room, megan reached across the table and patted his hand."it's okay that you're talking about emma.""speaking of old girlfriends or women you've dated while you're with another woman is never a good idea.""this is different.emma is my family."she swirled the wine around in her glass."i've heard her side of the story, but i don't think i've heard yours.""you heard a little when you were inebriated the night of noah's baptism."now it was megan's turn to grimace."i still would like to know."pesh drew in a ragged breath.when the waiter appeared with their salads, it appeared that he might dodge the question entirely.but once they were alone together, he smiled."emma came along at a time when i was facing extreme pressure from family and friends to move on from my grief and date again.there was no escape to it-i faced it at the hospital, as well as when i was at home.people seemed to think that once a year went by on the calendar that meant i was through with my mourning.then one day, there she was in the er.she was scared out of her mind about your grandfather.somehow i just connected with her through her grief and pain."he dabbed his mouth with his napkin."she reminded me so much of jade that it was easy to try to imagine that what i was feeling for her was romantic.i hadn't been out in so long that i wanted to woo her, just like i wanted to you.""and aidan came between you?""in a way, both he and jade did.""what do you mean?"pesh laughed."let's just say, during a very heated moment together, she was with aidan, and i was with jade."megan was surprised by his candor."i see."there was one item in the pesh and emma equation she had always wondered about."you didn't mind that she was pregnant?"shaking his head, pesh replied, "it just made her even more beautiful to me.i'd been through so much death that i guess i was drawn to her because she had life growing within her.""that's really beautiful," megan murmured.he gave her a mirthless laugh."one of my worst character faults is having a hero complex.i guess it's one of the reasons i became a doctor.i saw emma, and i wanted to save her.when she had to go on bed rest, i wanted to be her knight in shining armor.""being a hero is not exactly a bad character trait.""it is when you can't save someone, and you have to constantly live with the guilt."megan's heart ached at the pain on his face.sensing she needed to lighten the mood, she teased, "i'm glad to hear you actually have a bad character trait.i mean, you seemed a little too perfect to me."a shadow of a smile played on his lips."did i mention i'm a terrible slob?""you?never," she replied."oh yes.if i didn't have a housekeeper, i'm pretty sure i might end up on world's nastiest houses."megan laughed."i find that hard to believe.""it's the truth.i also have no athletic ability whatsoever."after chewing thoughtfully on her bite of salad, megan said, "but you're built like a football player.""i'm built because i go to the gym to work off stress.but if you put me on the field, i'd be a serious disappointment."she shook her head."that doesn't turn me off at all.i've had my fill of jocks.""oh?"he questioned.although he was trying to be nonchalant about it, she knew he wanted to hear the full story."dating jocks for me is poison, and when i did date one, i made sure to date the ones at the top of their game.my first athlete's influence caused me to ruin my chances at medical school.""that's horrible.""yes, it is.but what's worse is i didn't learn anything from my mistakes because i fell for another one."with a rueful smile, she added, "at least i got mason out of that one."pesh laced his fingers together."mason's father is a professional athlete?""yes, he plays football for the falcons.""you know i'm friends with the team's sports medicine doctor.i could probably arrange something for him.maybe a little icy hot in his cup?"at the mischievous twinkle in pesh's eyes, megan burst out laughing."i can not believe, you of all people, suggested such a thing."with a shrug, pesh replied, "it's a harmless prank.""i realize that.it's just i can't imagine someone like you would even think of doing something like that."when he started to open his mouth to argue, she held up her hand."i know, i know.don't pigeon hole you.""exactly."their main course arrived, and megan couldn't help digging into the wonderful aromatic food.as they ate, the conversation came easily.that was one of the things she liked most about pesh-he was so easy to talk to.because he was older, refined, and a doctor, she could have felt intimidated by him.but he never made her feel that way.he always seemed fascinated by every single thing she had to say, which was quite a change from most of the guys she dated.they were usually half listening to her while glancing over her shoulder at the tv to get the latest score.after they finished, the waiter took their plates."dessert?"megan asked, as she downed the last of her wine.pesh nodded his head toward the small dance floor."how about a dance instead?"she wrinkled her nose."i'm really not much of a dancer."he arched his brows at her as if he knew she was lying."okay, fine, i used to dance all the time back in high school and college.""then dance with me.""i'm not good at slow dancing.you'll probably regret asking me the moment we get out there."pesh stuffed a wad of bills into the bill envelope."as shakespeare would say, the lady do protesth too much.and i think i know the reason.""oh, you do?"he nodded."slow dancing is intimate, and you don't want to want to let yourself be intimate with me.""you went down on me in a supply closet.i think that's pretty intimate," she challenged."that was not intimacy.sexual acts are of the mind where our pleasure center is.intimacy is of the heart."he held her gaze."we both know you'll let me into your body but not your heart."knowing he was right, she crossed her arms over her chest and scowled at him.she didn't know why she just couldn't get up and go dance like he had asked.she'd slow danced a thousand times at parties.what was the difference here?somewhere deep down, she knew the answer to that question."if you don't want to dance, then let's go and see the city."not wanting to let him get the best of her, she rose out of her chair."fine.i'll dance with you."he chuckled."don't sound so thrilled."after he stood up, he took her hand and led her over to the dance floor.she started to wrap her arms around his neck like she was accustomed to, but he put one of her hands on his shoulder and then he took the other hand in his.his other hand slid around to rest at her lower back.the band finished the jazzier beats of a song and then switched over to another.a lone piano pounded out the opening chords.the lead singer's sultry voice filled the air, "like a flower waiting to bloom."megan immediately recognized the song as norah jones' turn me on.the electricity between them shifted, and as megan stared up into pesh's eyes, she saw desire and lust flaring in them.her gaze dropped down to his full lips, and she couldn't help wanting him to kiss her.as if he read her mind, pesh's mouth closed over hers.darting her tongue out, she sought to find his warmth.when she did, he tasted like a mixture of the wine and spices they'd eaten.his tongue pulled back to trace her lips as his h*ps jerked, pushing him against her.she followed his lead by pressing herself flush against him to where her br**sts were rubbing against his chest.she shivered when he groaned into her mouth.his thumb slid back and forth between her shoulder blades, and she couldn't help arching into his touch.as he pulled away from their kiss, he kept his eyes locked on hers.she'd never had a man stare at her so much.it was like he was trying to see through her to her very soul.it both overwhelmed and inflamed her at the same time.it was all part of his slow seduction plan, and it was working."please take me somewhere-somewhere we can be alone."his expression became pained."megan-" she brought her hand from his shoulder to cover his lips."don't make me beg to be with you anymore."shaking his head, he replied, "i can't deny you anymore, not after having a taste of you."megan shuddered at the intensity of both his words and the way he delivered them.taking her by the hand, he led her off the dance floor.they snaked around the tables in the dining area until they reached the exit.weaving through the people, they went into the hotel that adjoined the restaurant.it was actually more of a historic bed and breakfast than a hotel.as they neared the reception area, pesh dropped her hand to reach into his coat pocket.once he retrieved his wallet, he stepped up to the desk."i need a room please.""credit card and identification please," the inn keeper droned.as she sized him up, megan couldn't help thinking he looked rather pompous-the usual type of person who worked in a high-end place."would you prefer queen or-" "a king please," pesh requested through clenched teeth."do you need help with your luggage?""no, we don't have any."the man typed something into the computer."and how long will you be staying with us?""as long as we need," pesh replied, drumming his fingers on the marble counter.megan watched as the man's eyes widened and a flush entered his face.he quickly finished the reservation and handed pesh a key card."we have you in one of our balcony king suites.""thank you."taking her by the hand, pesh led her over to the elevators.when megan dared to glance over her shoulder, she saw the man peering curiously at them.as they stepped onto the car, megan couldn't help the nervous giggle that escaped her lips.when pesh looked at her in surprise, she laughed even harder."what is it?""by the way that conversation went down, he probably thinks i'm a prostitute."pesh's eyes widened."you don't seriously think that?""okay, maybe a high-end escort?"a growl came from low in his throat."do not demean yourself like that.""i'm not demeaning myself.think about it.we come in during the middle of the day with no luggage, and we want a hotel room with a king sized bed."she tapped her chin with her finger."hmm, what could we possibly be doing?"the corners of his lips turned up in a smile."i probably should care what the man thinks, but right now, i frankly don't give a shit."she laughed."me either."the elevator dinged, signaling they had reached their floor.they stepped out and read the signs to find their room.once pesh opened the door, megan walked inside.she took in the cozy decor of the room with its brick fireplace, antiques, and four-poster bed.going to a hotel could have been sleazy, but this room had such a romantic feel to it.when he came up behind her and slid his arms around her waist, she couldn't help suddenly feeling shy."are you all right?"he asked."i'm fine."his breath warmed against her ear."you tensed when i touched you.""i'm sorry.i didn't mean to.i guess i'm just nervous."pesh turned her around to face him."you don't have anything to feel nervous about.if you don't want to do this anymore, we don't have to.""no, i want to do it," she assured him.without another word, his fingers went to her hair.after he undid the clasp, her hair tumbled down over her shoulders.an appreciative shudder rippled through her when he nuzzled his face into the strands at her neck.from there he sought out the zipper at the middle of her back.slowly, he slid it down.when the back of the dress gaped open, he took the spaghetti straps and eased them over her shoulders and down her arms.megan felt his breath warming her back as the dress pooled onto the floor.she stepped out of it, and then turned to face him.the heat of his gaze stoked the fire burning deep inside her.his expression was fierce as he drank in her strapless black bra and panties, along with her heels."you are so beautiful."for some reason, she felt the urge to blush at his words.guys had told her she was beautiful before, but it didn't feel the same or sound the same coming from them as it did pesh.the way he said she was beautiful, coupled with the way he looked at her, made her tingle in all the right places.her hands came to his tie.after she loosened it, she ripped it off him and slung it to the floor.deftly, her fingers worked the buttons on his shirt.when she opened it, she sucked in a breath at the sight of the dusting of dark hair covering his chest.it trailed down over his washboard abs and down into his pants."you're pretty beautiful yourself," she said with a smile.as he shrugged off his shirt, her fingers went to his belt.the entire time she unbuttoned and unzipped him, his burning gaze took in everything she did."why do you keep staring at me?"she questioned quietly."i'm afraid if i look away, you won't be real."his hand cupped her cheek."i've wanted this for so long-i've wanted you for so long.it's hard to believe that you're really here.""touch me," she urged.she took his other hand and brought it to her breast."touch me and feel how real i am."lowering his head, his mouth hovered over hers."breathe me in," he instructed, as he kneaded her breast over her bra.at the feel of his breath against her lips, she inhaled while his heated gaze almost singed her cheeks.even if she had wanted to, she couldn't bring herself to look away from his eyes.when she exhaled, he inhaled, and it was like they were doing a dance.it was both relaxing and somewhat erotic.she'd never spent time just breathing and gazing into someone's eyes."now you've had your first lesson in tantra," he murmured against her lips.she jerked her head back to stare at him in surprise."are you going to do more?""maybe."he reached around to undo her bra."do you want me to?""i think so.""then i will.i want to do whatever is pleasing for you."she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him.he eased her over to the four-poster bed.after removing his pants and boxers, he slid her panties down her legs.as megan sat on the edge of the massive king sized bed, she widened her legs to allow him to step between them.when he brought his hand to stroke between her thighs, she moaned and let her head fall back.two fingers entered her and began a slow, teasing assault.she began to rock her h*ps against his hand, adding the friction she desired.when she felt his erection rubbing against her leg, she reached between them to take him in her hand.her eyelids fluttered open, and she stared into his face as they worked each other into a sweaty, panting frenzy.when pesh curled his fingers inside her, she bit down on her lip to keep from screaming out in pleasure.her orgasm rocketed through her lower half, causing her head to fall forward onto his chest.when she came back to herself, pesh was sliding her body up the mattress.then he was hovering over her, kissing her br**sts and licking her ni**les into hardened peaks."now, pesh," she urged."i want you deep inside of me."just as his head nudged against her opening, he stopped."oh no," he murmured before rocking back to sit on his knees.megan propped herself up on her elbows and gazed up at him."what's wrong?"she hoped that after giving in, he hadn't decided to back out at the last minute.he rubbed the stubble on his cheeks."i, uh... we can't do this without a condom, and i don't have one with me.""oh," she murmured.in the heat of the moment, she had totally forgotten about that."you don't happen to have one?"he asked hopefully.she shook her head."sorry.""it's me who ought to be sorry for putting you in a position like this without protection."when he started to pull away, she sat up to grab his shoulders, urging him to stop."we can still do this.neither one of us has been with anybody in at least two years-we've had tests for the hospital.""that's all well and good but what about pregnancy?are you on the pill?""no."she chewed on her bottom lip momentarily."wait a minute," she murmured.in her mind, she began counting down the days since her last period."twenty.""twenty what?""i'm on day twenty, so we should be safe.""i'll still pull out.""if you say so," she replied.gripping his biceps, she urged him to cover her again with his body.she loved the feel of his chest hairs rubbing against her ni**les.pesh widened her legs, and then he eased inside her, filling and stretching her walls.it had been so long that she couldn't help feeling a bit of a sting."are you all right?""i'm fine."he withdrew and flexed his hips, thrusting back inside her.this time they both moaned.setting up a rhythm, he began rocking in and out of her.the pace was slow and sensual, and while he was hitting all the right spots, she wanted more.the entire time he moved in and out of her, he kept his eyes locked firmly on hers.his gaze was so dark with desire that she didn't dare look away.the longer she stared into his eyes, the more connected with him she felt.the old saying was that the eyes were windows to the soul, and she was getting a pretty good glimpse into his.and that scared the hell out of her.wanting to make things less sensual, she gripped his biceps."harder," she panted.rising on his knees, he slid his forearms under the backs of her knees.this enabled him to pull her back against his pounding thrusts.while their connection at first had been so intimate, this was more about lust and desire.she reached up and clasped his face in her hands, bringing his head down to hers.their mouths and tongues met in frenzied kisses.when he pulled out of her, megan whimpered at the loss of feeling.he quickly flipped her over onto her stomach.pulling on her hips, he raised her up onto her knees.when he reentered her, megan moaned.with each thrust, he went deeper and deeper.her fingers fisted the sheets as he leaned over her back, kissing a trail down her spine.she didn't know how he was able to be so many places at once.while his mouth licked her back and teasingly left love bites, his hands were rubbing her thighs and then sliding under her to squeeze her br**sts or tease her clit.he was giving her so much that she couldn't stay silent.she moaned, chanted his name, and cried out as the sounds of their wet skin slapped together.finally, she couldn't take it anymore.dropping her head, she screamed into the mattress as she found her release.once her walls finished clenching, she felt pesh withdraw from her.as he groaned, megan felt warmth spurt onto her back and bu**ocks.after seeing him come before, she hated she couldn't see his face.he was so beautiful when he was finding release.once he finished, she eased down onto her stomach and curled a pillow under her head.after a few seconds, pesh lay down beside her.she turned her head and met his gaze.exhausted and completely sexually satisfied for the first time in her life, all she could muster to say was, "wow."a slow grin spread across his cheeks."you seem to say that a lot around me after orgasms."she laughed."it's because you render me absolutely speechless with your talents.""thank you.i could say the same about you."his gaze left her face and trailed down her na**d back."we need to get you cleaned up."rolling her shoulder blades, she said, "i kinda like it.makes me feel marked or something."he smiled shyly at her."i like the idea of marking you-making you mine."he wanted her to be his.she didn't know quite what to think about that statement.did she want to be his?she certainly couldn't imagine belonging to anyone else.besides the amazing physical chemistry they shared, she was starting to feel such a deep connection to him.staring over at him, she couldn't help wondering what was going on in his mind."we've really done it now, haven't we?""yes, i do believe that was the universal "it" that we just did," he teased.she smacked his arm playfully."that's not what i meant.""i know," he murmured."no matter what, this changes everything.""for the better, i hope.""i suppose."the truth was she'd never really had casual sex before.there was one time her freshman year that she hooked up with a guy at work.it was the first and only time she'd ever done anything so crazy.in that instance, the sex had been over before she'd known it and without her coming even once.after that fiasco, she had never wanted a repeat performance with him or any other random guy, until she'd found herself in a sex slump after mason's birth.but with pesh, the sex had been... She shivered as the remaining echoes washed over her.before sleeping with pesh, she could count the number of past sexual partners on one hand, as well as the times she had had even remotely good sex.for megan, her experience with pesh was seriously earth shattering and life altering.she couldn't imagine just walking away now.pesh sat up and edged to the side of the bed.he held out his hand to her."come on.let's shower.""if you insist."she slid over to him before throwing a leg over the side of the mattress.although she should have felt a little bashful being na**d in front of him, she felt surprisingly comfortable.when she got into the bathroom, she raised her brows in surprise."a clawfoot tub?"she questioned.pesh laughed."all the old charm but modern conveniences."he pointed to the detachable shower head."nice."he turned on the water and waited for it to heat up.once he decided it was warm enough, he took her by the hand and helped her inside.she turned her back to the spray, letting the water clean her up.pesh didn't seem to think that was enough because after he soaped up his hands, he began to wash off her back and ass.as his magic hands massaged in slow strokes, she couldn't resist asking the question that was plaguing her."did i feel different?"his hands stilled on her lower back."what do you mean?"glancing at him over her shoulder, she replied, "that was the first time i've had sex since i gave birth to mason.i just wondered if i felt different.you know, inside."his face came to nuzzle her neck."you felt amazing.""not any different?""did you hear me complaining?""no, but i just worried.""you have nothing to worry about, my love."his hand skimmed over her ribcage to cup her breast.as her nipple hardened beneath his fingers, she sucked in a pleased breath."i want nothing more than to be back inside you as soon as i can.""then why don't you?"she challenged."fine then.put your hands on the tile," he ordered."yes, sir," she teased before placing her palms on the cool, wet tile.pesh slid the gleaming silver shower head between her legs, causing her to gasp at the contact.then he flicked his wrist to the side, sending the jets of water pounding into her clit.she moaned and threw her head back against his drenched chest.slowly he started moving the shower head to where it would rub against her.each time she moved back, the water hit her in just the right spot.she arched her h*ps as the pressure began to build.pesh slid his free hand up over her ribcage to cup her breast.he kneaded the flesh, pinching the ni**les that were already hardened.she pinched her eyes shut from the sensory overload.just as she would feel herself about to come, he would shift his wrist so the vibrations hit her in another area, building her again."please, pesh," she moaned."what, baby?""please make me come.""have you had enough pleasure yet, or should we continue on?"he asked, moving the shower head away from her.she groaned at the loss.rubbing her ass against his hardened erection, she begged, "you let me come, and then i'll make sure you do as well."with his knee, he nudged her legs even further apart.when he once again brought the shower head between her legs, it reached even more sensitive areas.it took only a few seconds of the water coupled with his rubbing and her grinding to cause her to scream with the pulsing convulsions.she smacked her hands against the walls as wave after wave pulsed through her.when she finally stopped shuddering, she slowly slid around to smile up at pesh."wow?"he said, with a smile.she teasingly pinched his arm."i was going to say exquisitely amazing.""i'm sure you were."reaching between them, she took his erection in her hands."good thing i'm about to get on my knees because i don't think i could stand after all that," she said, with a teasing wink.bending her head, she began trailing kisses down his wet chest.as she stroked him, she took time to kiss and then suck on his ni**les.his groan told her she was finding some of his most sensitive places.after teasing his ni**les to erect points, she continued on down his delicious washboard abs and through the dark hair that crowned his erection.sinking down onto the floor of the tub, she stroked him hard from base to tip.when his chest began to heave, she leaned over to slide him into her mouth."megan," he groaned, his fingers coming to tangle in the wet strands of her hair.she took him as far back as she could before sliding him out.her tongue flicked over the sensitive head before she suctioned it.when she released him again, she began long licks up his length.then she once again slid him in her mouth and began bobbing her head up and down his length.his groans began to echo throughout the bathroom."oh, megan," pesh murmured.his grip on her hair tightened as he flexed his h*ps to go even deeper into her mouth.when he started tightening up, he tried to pull away, but she gripped his thighs and held him in place.he cried out and then came in a rush into her mouth.she swallowed all of him before she glanced up to see him staring down at her with such adoration in his face."thank you."as he fell free from her mouth, she smiled."you're welcome."he helped her up off the tub floor."we better hurry up before we use all the hot water in these old pipes.""i think you would probably do a good job keeping me warm."he smiled."i feel the same way about you."although they were tempted for another round, megan knew pesh didn't want to chance it without any condoms.instead, she tore herself away from him when they finished their shower.she blew her hair dry while he got dressed.once she finished, he helped her slide back into her dress.then they left their suite without even turning down the bed.when they got downstairs, megan inwardly groaned that the same man was at the reception desk.she knew from his expression that he recognized them as well.as pesh handed him the key card, megan decided to make the most of the situation.she rubbed pesh's arm."thanks again, mr. nadeen.make sure to call me again next time you're in savannah.i love big spenders like you," she purred.while the man's eyes bulged, pesh stared at megan like she had grown another head.his mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water, but no words of admonishment came out.when he finally, recovered, he tersely replied, "i'll try to remember that, miss mckenzie."truly playing her part, megan turned on her heels and started walking across the lobby.she didn't get far before pesh was at her side.after shoving the hotel bill into his suit pocket, he slid his arm around her waist, drawing her close against him."you are in so much trouble," he growled into her ear.she giggled as they walked out of the hotel."mmm, are you going to punish me by taking me over your knee and spanking me?""i just might," he replied.tilting her head, she eyed him in the street lights."you can't seriously expect me to believe that you of all people are into bdsm?""no, i'm not."she snorted."once again, that doesn't surprise me."when he stopped walking right in the middle of the crowded street, she stared up at him in surprise."a good spanking, some handcuffs, and a blindfold all have possibilities.as far as all that other stuff?"his thumb came up to trail slowly across her bottom lip."if one truly knows how to f**k, you don't need any accessories and embellishments."she licked her lips as a little shiver went down her spine."and you certainly know what you're doing.you just got me wet right here in the middle of the street."his jaw clenched as he took her by the arm."don't say anything else like that.i need to get you home.""to your bed?"she asked."i wish.but you need to go home to your family."megan didn't argue with him because she knew he was right.she had a son to think about.regardless of how tempting it was, she just couldn't go on some pleasure binge when she was a mother.but there was a part of megan that didn't want the bubble to burst by leaving pesh and going home to her regular life.she wanted nothing more than go back to his place.sex with pesh had been phenomenal.and despite being a little sore from underuse, she certainly felt ready for more.sex, that was.pesh grabbed them a taxi, and they made the drive back to the airport.even though they didn't speak, megan didn't feel awkward around him after what they had done.he sat as close to her as he could with her hand clasped in his.once they got back to the plane, she felt exhaustion begin to set in.leaning back against the headrest, she closed her eyes as pesh went about getting them ready to take off.she only opened her eyes again when she felt them start racing down the runway.when they got into the air, she couldn't help sitting on the edge of her seat and peering out the windows at the city lights."it's so beautiful in the dark.""sometimes i think i favor flying at night.""you do?"he nodded."for some reason, it seems much more tranquil.there's a vulnerability to it as well.in the day, everything is within your sight distance.but in the dark, you have to rely on your instruments and instincts.""i'd love to learn how to fly.""you would?"she nodded."i've always thought it would be something amazing to learn.""then i'll teach you."she turned to him in surprise."really?""sure.why not?"with a shrug, she replied, "you're a busy man, and i don't know how fast a learner i would be."he smiled."for you i would make time."as she stared at him across the small interior of the plane, she knew she was ready to make more time for him as well.where it would lead them, she couldn't wait to see.chapter fifteen as the cornflower-blue horizon spread out for miles and miles before her, megan couldn't help fighting the urge to pinch herself.she was actually up in pesh's plane during her first flight lesson.from the moment they had taken off, she had been overwhelmed by such a surreal feeling.it must've been something about being in control of the plane as it rocketed down the runway and then took off into the sky.of course, she really wasn't in total control of the plane.pesh was able to take over at any moment from his spot in the co-pilot's seat.that made her feel a little better considering she had so little flying experience, and the manual she had read at least twice didn't prepare you for everything.now as they coasted along the city skyline, she kept both hands firmly gripping the steering wheel, or yoke as it was called in small plane terminology, as they passed through wispy strands of white clouds.when pesh had first offered to give her flying lessons, megan didn't know if she should believe him or not.looking back, she wasn't sure why she ever doubted him considering he was always a man of his word.and now, just two weeks after their first date in savannah, they were back up in the air flying around atlanta on a thursday afternoon.it had been quite a week together of having dinner after work or them picking up something on the way to her house.although, the first day back at work proved both difficult and awkward as they tried to appear as though nothing had changed.but the fact was everything had changed, and it wasn't just because they had become physical.as much as megan tried to fight her growing feelings for pesh, it was virtually impossible.a man like him made it too hard for any woman not to fall in love with him, and as much as she didn't want to acknowledge it, she could see herself falling for him.of course, he was also full of surprises.like on monday when he had asked her to see if there was an extra heart monitor in one of the empty patient rooms on the first floor.she had obediently gone to check.while she found the heart monitor, she also found him.the gentleman she had once known became somewhat of a sex fiend when he locked the door and disappeared with her behind the curtain.a mid-day sex session in an empty hospital bed made for quite an experience, especially when the brake on the bed released, and they literally banged into the walls.but besides the naughty sexcapade, he'd wanted to spend down time with her and mason.earlier in the week, pesh brought mason to see his plane.megan had to smile at the image in her mind of mason on pesh's lap in the pilot's seat as he explained the ins and outs of the buttons and knobs.pesh had shown such patience with mason by constantly fielding his questions and letting him wear one of the headsets.he'd even gotten the atc to send a message over the headset so mason could hear.while it was supposed to be a pre-flying lesson for her, it turned educational for mason as well.and to make it a day that neither mason, nor pesh would forget, they'd gone by mcdonald's afterwards so mason could play on the playground.the fact that pesh was so willing to do anything to make mason happy was slowly starting to crack megan's tough resolve against dating him.it wasn't just the fact that pesh was so wonderful with mason that had her reeling.when they talked, she shared more with him than she ever had with a man.he made it easy to open up to and speak of both the good and the bad in her life.he was such a good listener that she never felt like she was just rattling on and boring him.he truly seemed interested in everything she said.it was an amazing feeling."still doing okay over there?"pesh asked, bringing her out of her thoughts.she grinned."fine.""i wish you could see your face," he mused."do i have some dopey expression?"she asked."it isn't dopey.it's wide-eyed wonderment like a kid on christmas morning.""oh, i would totally believe it since this certainly feels like a very big and very dangerous toy.""it's a wonderful sight to see.i'm so glad i get to share this with you."he took one of her hands from the yoke and brought it to his mouth.as his lips kissed over her knuckles, she tensed."i need my hand back.i don't feel like i have a good grip on the steering wheel like you said i should," she protested.pesh sighed and released her hand."how i regret telling you that tip now," he lamented.she smiled."that's not fair to try and distract me.i need to focus, so we don't crash.""all right.i'll keep my hands to myself... for now."a shudder went through her at his words.at that moment if there was any way possible to actually fly the plane and bang him, she would have tried.shaking her head, she tried ridding herself of her inappropriate thoughts."what's that?"she asked, pointing at a dark blip far down on the horizon.pesh leaned forward in his seat, peering out the windshield."looks like a storm cloud moving in.""we should head back then."he chuckled."i don't think it's going to affect us.""yeah, well, i don't like the thought of trying to fly in a storm.""then we'll head back.""which way should i turn the plane?""let's take a right," pesh replied.megan bobbed her head and then turned the yoke at the same time she pressed on the right rudder pedal with her foot."good.keep it coming.we're almost turned around."once they were facing the opposite direction, pesh said, "now let's bring up the speed."she did as she was told and waited for him to give her any further instructions."we're good to go now.when we're about ten minutes out from mccollum, you need to let the atc know we're coming in.""okay.i can do that.""do you have plans for this evening?""not that i know of.""would you like to have dinner with me?"she nibbled on her bottom lip to keep from laughing at his formalness."i suppose so.do i get dessert afterwards?"his body tensed beside her."are you implying that i'm dessert, or that after we finish dinner i should get you dessert?"megan laughed."no, i want you for dessert.""then you can have me.always."glancing over at him, she said, "i might have to ask for a to-go box since i'm assuming we'll have mason with us.""i don't mind.i enjoy spending time with him."megan couldn't keep the smile off her face at pesh's words."he really likes being with you, too.i've never seen him warm up to a stranger as much as he has to you.""i'm a likeable guy," he teased."yeah, you are," she murmured, trying not to let the out-of-control fluttering of her heart make her think more than she should about him.pesh interrupted her thoughts by motioning to the controls."go ahead and start doing your landing checks."megan vaguely remembered what knobs and meters she had looked at before they took off.once she got through the landing checks with pesh's help, they were getting closer to mccollum."now radio atc.""um, okay," megan replied, nibbling on her lip.after clearing his throat, megan glanced over at pesh.he motioned to the yoke."oh, duh," she replied.with her thumb, she pressed the push-to-talk button."this is cessna 172 coming in for landing."before she could ask pesh if she had done it right, he relayed a different message over his push-to-talk.the atc's response crackled over her headset."cessna 172, this is ground control confirming you are clear to land.""now push on the yoke to start the descent," pesh instructed.after she did what she was told, her eyes locked on the speedometer."should we be picking up this much speed?""yes and no," pesh replied."what the hell does that mean?"she asked, jerking her wild gaze to his.he chuckled."see the black knob there labeled'throttle'?""yeah.""look at it this way.you know when you're in a car and you're going downhill, you pick up speed?"megan nodded."it's the same thing in a plane.but if you pull on the throttle knob, it reduces the engine power so there won't be an increase in speed."with her fingers grasping the black knob, megan asked, "how hard do i need to pull on it?""try pulling back half-way."after pulling on the knob, megan eyed the speed."we're slowing down.""good.""are we at ninety knots?"megan glanced down."yeah.""okay, then lower the nose just a little bit.that will give us a glide-path or a controlled descent."megan eased on the steering wheel until the nose of the plane dipped below the horizon."now put the landing gear in the down position," pesh instructed."is that the button with the little tire on it?""yep, that's the one."megan pressed it."got it.""using the steering wheel, roll the wings a little to the right, so we're lined back up with the runway."megan turned the steering wheel to the right a little too abruptly."oops," she replied."it's okay.just level it out.you always want your runway target spot to stay in the same fixed spot on the windshield."as megan stared ahead, she realized how close they were getting to the runway, and in turn, the ground.suddenly she wasn't so sure if she could land the plane.it was one thing taking off, but it seemed like there was so much more that could go wrong when landing."u-uh, p-pesh," she stammered."yeah?"he asked casually."i don't think i can do this."she cut her eyes over to him."i can't land the plane.it's too scary.""yes, you can."megan shook her head furiously back and forth."no really.you need to take back the controls.i could cause us to crash.""but i have faith in you.""really?""of course.i wouldn't let you do this if i didn't think you could."she stole a glance at him, taking in his earnest expression.god, he really and truly believed in her.and it wasn't just about the fact they were banging each other every chance they got alone.no, he saw through to the real her.after taking a deep breath, she felt herself slowly calming down."fine.i'll try, but i'm not making any promises.""that's my girl," pesh replied."what should i do now?""all right, now you need to pull the throttle all the way out as well as pulling back on the wheel to keep the nose from dipping."clearing her throat that felt as dry as sandpaper, megan jerked on the throttle button before pulling on the steering wheel.it was a little harder considering how sweaty her hands were."keep it steady.you're doing great."as they came closer and closer to the runway, megan fought the urge to close her eyes, but she realized that would not be the right thing to do.instead, she braced herself for the impact.the moment the wheels hit the asphalt she shrieked and clutched at the steering wheel."don't fight the bounce.we're fine.you're fine."they skidded along the pavement."okay, now ease up on the wheel and push on the tops of both pedals to apply the brakes."without thinking, megan stomped her feet, causing the plane to screech."easy," pesh said.she let her feet off the brakes, and they began to coast."now you're going to bring it back into the hanger.""oh, hell no!i would end up mowing out the side of the building or another plane!"megan cried.pesh's amused chuckle died quickly at the death glare she shot him."megan, you'll do fine.you just landed a plane.i think you can handle pulling into a hanger."she scowled at him."fine.but when you have to file a huge insurance claim, i'm going to say'i told you so."'"we'll see," he replied.she could tell he was fighting back a smile the way he kept biting down on his lip."all right, take a right here," he said, pointing to where the runaway split.she turned the wheel to the right and began easing her foot down on the brake when she saw the hangers come into view."which one is yours?""i share the third one.luckily for you, it's pretty much a straight shot in.just watch out for my dad's plane."megan jerked her horrified gaze over to his."i could be taking out your dad's plane?"pesh shook his head."you're not going to take out anyone's plane, megan.i have faith in you."she gripped the steering wheel until her knuckles turned white.after taking a deep breath and giving herself a mental pep talk, she started slowly easing the plane inside the hanger.even though she was far away from the back wall, she hit the brakes."is this okay?""looks good to me.now you want to pull on the red knob.""the one that says mixture?""yeah, that's the one.it will kill the engine."when megan pulled on the knob, the plane shuddered into silence.she couldn't help sitting absolutely frozen for a few moments, processing everything that had happened.pesh's hand reached out to rub her shoulder."you okay over there?"he asked.turning her head, she smiled."i think so.""you were starting to worry me for a minute.""i think i was worrying myself."pesh's warm laugh made her tingle in parts it shouldn't.with the adrenaline depleting from her system, she knew exactly what she wanted to do.or maybe the more appropriate word was who she wanted to do.frantically, she unbuttoned her seat belt and dove over into his lap."megan, what in the hell are you doing?"he demanded.her response to his question was to kiss him.greedily her mouth devoured his lips.as her tongue thrust into his mouth, her hand went between them to cup his growing erection.he groaned while she worked him over his pants.when she rose up on her knees to get a better grip of him, she banged her head against the ceiling of the plane."shit!""are you all right?"he asked, bringing his hands up to cup her now aching head."i'm fine."he snickered."the last thing you need is a concussion.how would we explain that one?"megan giggled."maybe turbulence during the flight?""you're the one creating turbulence," he replied, a wicked gleam in his eyes."how are we going to do this?"she asked."backseat," he replied.with a nod, she began climbing over him into the small two seats in the back.as pesh unbuckled his seat belt, megan's fingers furiously worked to get her jeans unzipped and unbuttoned.she was easing them down her thighs when his body came over hers.she once again claimed his mouth as pesh worked to get his own pants down."pocket.condom," he murmured against her lips.she nodded and then reached her hand down to dig out the foil wrapper.during high school, she gotten used to ha**ng s*x in cars, but this was taking it to a whole new level.somehow without being able to see him in the small confines of the plane's backseat, she rolled the condom down pesh's length.when she felt his hardness pressing against her core, she widened her legs as far as she could in the cramped quarters.with one quick thrust, he was buried deep inside her.she gripped his shoulders, pushing against him to keep from knocking back into the seat.considering where they were, there was no time for soft and sweet.instead, the sounds in the air were of skin slapping together as pesh's movements were frantic against her.she loved every delicious minute of it, and it wasn't too long before she felt herself going over the edge.her nails raked over his back as she screamed his name.with her walls milking pesh's erection, he came with a shout, crushing her body with his.just when she thought she couldn't breathe, he jerked back."are you okay?""i'm fine," she replied.she cupped his cheek."really good now, thanks to you."he gave her the shy smile of his that warmed her all over."i'm glad to hear that.""um, dr.nadeen?"someone called outside the plane."oh shit," he muttered, as he slid out of her body.as he went about ridding himself of the condom and jerking his pants up, he called, "yeah, trace?""i was just concerned about you considering you landed a few minutes ago and hadn't deplaned.and then there was a lot of knocking going on inside the plane."megan's hand flew over her mouth as she started giggling uncontrollably.it probably didn't help that as trace was talking, she had noticed that the windows of the plane were fogged up."i appreciate your concern, trace.i was just checking on some post-flight issues.i'll be out in just a moment."as pesh finished and climbed into the front seat, megan hurried to get her jeans up.once she had them buttoned and zipped, she smoothed down her hair that had to look like she had just been f**ked against an airplane seat.she slid into the passenger seat to find that pesh had opened the driver's side and was talking to trace.trace's gaze left pesh's and came to hers.it took only a few seconds for him to put two and two together of what had actually been going on.he slowly started backing away from the plane."yeah, well, you two have a nice day then," he said."same to you," megan called, trying not to start giggling again.pesh shook his head as he hopped down out of the plane."come on.let's go before we get in any more trouble.""but getting in trouble is so much fun," megan protested, as she opened her door.he grinned at her as he came around to meet her."you, my lovely, are a very bad influence."he wrapped his arms around her waist, drawing her close to him."but i'm grateful for every moment i have with you.""mmm, you know just how to flatter a girl," she said, before kissing him.after a few heated moments, pesh pulled away."considering this hanger has security cameras, let's not totally give them all our secrets today."megan squealed and covered her mouth."did they... Can they...?""not inside the backseat."she exhaled with relief."thank goodness."he laughed."come on, little troublemaker.let's go get something to eat.""sounds good to me."with a wink, she added, "especially if there's dessert!"chapter sixteen a few days after her flying adventure and partial induction in the mile high club, megan had started to take a few scripts to the pharmacy when she was yanked by the arm and dragged into an examining room."what the?"she began, as the door was slammed behind her.instead of pesh before her, it was kristi."i need to have a word with you."anxiety bubbled in megan's chest, and she had to take a few deep breaths before she could speak."have i done something wrong with a patient?"kristi shook her head."oh no, this has everything to do with dr.nadeen."megan's brows shot up in surprise."pesh?what's wrong with him?""it's not what is wrong with him.it's what is wrong with you."megan gulped."me?"kristi nodded."i really like you, megan, but i am worried that you are just playing him.it is cruel.he doesn't deserve it.""i don't know what you mean.""please don't play coy.not only do i have two daughters around your age, but i've spent enough time working with women to have a pretty good insight into the female mind.so, i'll ask once again, what are you doing?"megan squirmed under the heat of kristi's stare.if anyone found out that she and pesh were hooking up, it could be very bad for her nursing career."we're friends.he's my cousin's godfather."kristi rolled her eyes."fine.let me speak as freely as i can since you insist on playing dumb.i don't give two shits if you and pesh are screwing all over this hospital-" megan was unable to contain her loud gasp."excuse me, but i-" now it was kristi's turn to interrupt.she held up her hands."let me finish please.""fine," megan muttered."i realize that deep down he's just a man, and after going a long time without sex, it was probably a little easier for him to give in to just a causal relationship with you.but i've worked by his side for seven years, so i have a pretty good handle on what he's truly feeling.""oh really?"megan countered, unable to stop herself from being snarky."yes, i do.that man loves you with every fiber of his being."those words caused megan's steely resolve to fade.she couldn't help staggering a bit on her feet.she knew that pesh liked her-i mean, any fool could see that.but love?"h-he does?""oh yeah, he does.he's been holding a candle for you since the moment you walked in here.i saw it the first day i introduced you two.i don't know what has happened since that day, but i know something has changed for you, too.""it's true that i care about him.he's the most amazing man i've ever known.""then what the hell is the problem?""i wish i could tell you, but i don't even know myself," megan moaned as tears stung her eyes."dammit, stupid pms hormones.""oh honey, you do actually care about him, don't you?""yes," she whispered."and you're a wreck about what you're feeling for him, aren't you?"kristi asked.megan couldn't hold back the sobs any longer.they rolled through her, causing her to bend at the waist under the burden.kristi stepped forward, wrapping her arms around megan.even though she knew she should try to fight her emotions considering she was at work, she decided to let herself go and get it all out.when she finally had a hold of herself, she raised her head, wiping what she imagined were the hideous black mascara streaks off her face."i'm so sorry.that was so unprofessional of me."kristi gave her a sad smile."would you stop that, please?this isn't an evaluation.besides, i'm the one who pulled you in here and provoked you.you always keep your emotions in check out on the floor.""the truth is i do care for pesh.how could i not?i'm just not sure i'm the right woman for him.""but if he loves you, how could you think you're not the right one?"megan blurted out all the reasons she'd previously given pesh about her age and her lack of wanting a committed relationship.when she finally finished unburdening herself of all her doubts and fears, she glanced up at kristi.there was no judgment in her eyes or anger for that matter.instead, she merely patted megan's cheek."oh honey, you've got to tune all those negative voices out and go with your heart."megan shook head."but what if i don't know what my heart is telling me to do?""you will.just give it time."kristi patted her back."why don't you go get cleaned up and then take your lunch break?""no, i need to make up for the time i've missed.""you're fine."she motioned to the door."go on.see if dr. Nadeen is on his way to lunch so you can join him.""but i shouldn't.it won't look right if we're alone together."kristi chuckled."alone together in a crowded hospital cafeteria?i don't think that's possible."megan nibbled on her bottom lip and fought the urge to argue with kristi.after all, if the very woman who was in charge of her clinical grade didn't give a shit about her and pesh being seen together, why should she?finally, she just gave a defeated sigh."okay, i'll go see.""good girl.and you be listening to your heart now.okay?""i'll try.i promise."although she spoke the words with such conviction of character, megan was afraid it was going to be harder than she thought.chapter seventeen when pesh arrived at work the following day, he found kristi alone in the nurses' station.gazing around, he asked, "where's megan?""oh, she called in sick today."both disappointment and concern filled him.she had seemed a little off the night before when they had dinner together in the cafeteria.she was quieter and somewhat withdrawn.he had just chalked it up to the fact that they were sitting with some of the other staff and she was trying not to make things seem weird with them now.he wondered if he should call her and check to make sure she was okay.they were in such limbo together that even though it sounded like the right thing to do, he wasn't sure.with a resigned sigh, he decided to leave things as they were and vowed to check on her tomorrow when she returned to work.as much as pesh hated to admit it, the day dragged mercilessly without megan.he went from patient to patient with a monotony he hadn't felt in a long time.when his shift ended, he met kristi in the hallway."want me to walk you out?"he suggested."thank you.i'd appreciate that.""it would be my pleasure."they started out the mechanized doors to the employee parking lot.to fill the quiet of their shoes echoing on the pavement, he said, "i hated to hear that megan wasn't feeling well.""so did i.poor thing offered to pull a double tomorrow to make up for being gone."kristi smiled."she sure is going to make a fine nurse.""yes, she is.""you've taken a special interest in her, haven't you?"kristi asked.pesh's steps momentarily faltered, and he stumbled."whatever do you mean?"kristi chuckled."you know exactly what i mean.""it is true that we know each other outside of the hospital, but when we're in the er, our relationship is strictly professional.""i never said it wasn't."after gazing around the somewhat deserted parking lot, he shook his head."what you're alluding to between me and megan?nothing good can come of those types of rumors."patting his arm, kristi smiled."there are no rumors-merely an observation by someone who loves and admires you."his brows rose in surprise."you don't disapprove?""of course not.i think it's a good match for both you and her."he remained silent for a few moments, contemplating her words."perhaps i should call and check on her.""i think that would be a very good idea."she took her keys out of her purse and motioned at the honda they were standing in front of."well, this is me.""have a good night, kristi.""same to you, dr. Nadeen.and good luck."he smiled."thank you.i appreciate that."when he got to his car, he slid inside and took his phone out.he scrolled through his contacts to find megan's number.after he dialed, he anxiously drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.the call went to her voicemail, leaving him with a defeated feeling.although he knew it probably wasn't the best idea in the world, he decided to go to her house to check on her.the moment he rang her parents' doorbell he really regretted making a house call.one of her younger brothers answered."hey, what's up?"he asked."hello.i'm dr. nadeen.i work with megan."snapping his fingers, he pointed at pesh."wait, i know you.aren't you noah's godfather?"pesh smiled."yes, i am.""cool.listen man, megan's downstairs.if you go around the side of the house, she has her own door.""i see.thank you then.""no problem."when the door closed, pesh debated going straight to his car.but he knew it would look even worse if her brother told her he had been there and then he had left without seeing her.heaving a frustrated breath, he headed off the porch.he followed the sidewalk around the house to where it sloped down the hill.at the side door, he knocked loudly.when the door flew open, megan stared at him in a mixture of both surprise and horror."what are you doing here?"she demanded.pesh shoved his hands in his pockets."you called in sick today.i was worried.""i'm fine."he fought the urge to say that by her disheveled appearance and dark circles under her eyes, she most certainly didn't seem fine."i tried calling you, but you didn't answer.kristi and i were worried about you."her expression softened a little."i'm sorry.i must've forgotten to charge my phone.""can i get you something to eat?some soup maybe?""really, i'm fine.""but you look so pale.will you let me do an exam?you know the flu is-" "i don't have the flu.""how can you be sure if you haven't been checked?did you get the flu shot at the hospital?sometimes it can give you a mild case."she shook her head and smiled."i don't have the flu.since you're going to keep on and on, i'm going to go ahead and tell you.i have really horrendous cramps with my period.usually, i can manage them with birth control, but when i started clinicals and stopped working, i couldn't afford the birth control without health insurance.and it wasn't like i was ha**ng s*x anyway."while he appreciated her honesty, he was also slightly mortified."oh, i see.""i'm sorry to have embarrassed you," megan said.he waved his hand dismissively."listen, when you return to work tomorrow, there will be a script for you for birth control.i don't like the idea of you in pain, so i don't want this to happen next month.""but the money," she protested.he shook his head."it will be discounted through the hospital pharmacy.""thank you, pesh.that's a very decent thing for you to do."a blonde head peeked around megan."hi esh.you play?"he smiled at mason."i came to check on your mommy."mason tilted his chin to look up at megan."her tummy hurts.she no play.u play?""um, well..." he wanted nothing more than to spend time with mason, and in the same token, with megan as well.but he was also walking such a fine line with her that he didn't want to come on too strong and scare her off."i'm not sure your mommy feels up to company."megan smiled."if you really don't mind staying, we'd love to have you.""are you certain?""sure.""okay then."mason grabbed his hand and led him through the door.pesh took in the cozy decor of the basement apartment.in one chair, megan's textbooks and papers were strewn around, while on the floor it looked like a tornado had blown through the living room with all the toys lying around.when he met her gaze, she flushed."sorry it's such a mess.""it's fine.""are you hungry?"she asked."no, i'm good," he lied, as his stomach rumbled.megan cocked her head and shot him a look."sit down and let me fix you something.""not with you feeling unwell.""although i wish i could cook you something, i think i'm up to reheating some of the pizza we ordered today, or there are some homemade enchiladas i made last night," she replied, as she opened the fridge."enchiladas would be lovely."she smiled and took out a casserole dish."you hungry, mace?""mmm, hmm," he murmured, barely looking up at his mother from one of his toys.after spooning out two heaping plates full, along with some rice, she put it in the microwave.she then motioned for him to have a seat at the table."you don't need to wait on me.""just shut up and let me take care of you for two seconds."her words reminded him of when she had cleaned his wounds after dev's punch.no matter what the situation, she was always ready to be there for him and take care of him.the microwave beeped and brought him out of his thoughts.mason hurried over to the table and sat down beside pesh in his booster seat.when megan put down the steaming plates, he reached for her hand and kissed it."thank you."a funny look passed in her eyes before she smiled."you're welcome.""won't you sit with us?"he asked."actually, i would love to take a warm bath.you know, to see if it would help relax my muscles."pesh smiled."i'll be happy to keep an eye on mason while you do that.""you don't mind?""of course i don't.""thanks.i really appreciate it."she kissed the top of mason's head, and then kissed his cheek.she turned to start into the bedroom before whirling back around.he lowered his fork at the expression on her face.placing her hands on his cheeks, she leaned in and laid a big one on him.he couldn't hide his surprise.when she pulled away, she grinned at his speechlessness."i won't be long," she said.once the bedroom door closed behind her, pesh gazed over at mason."what do you want to do when we finish eating?""minions," he mumbled through a mouthful of food.pesh furrowed his brows in confusion."what's minions?"hopping down off his chair, mason ran over to the tv.when he returned, he had a dvd box in his hand.he pointed to some yellow blobs on the cover."minions.""ah, i see.you want to watch this."mason bobbed his head."is it your favorite?"pesh asked."uh, huh," mason replied."then i guess we better eat fast so we can watch it."at mason's beaming grin, pesh felt a little tug in his chest.even though he shouldn't, he already had strong feelings for the little boy.from almost the moment they'd met, mason had let pesh into his world.the sound of a fork clattering on a plate brought pesh out of his thoughts."done!"mason exclaimed, hopping out of his chair.although pesh wasn't finished, mason grabbed his hand and led him from the table.instead of arguing with him, pesh just let himself be dragged over to the tv.once he got the movie on, they settled down on the couch.he couldn't fight the warmth that spread through his chest when mason snuggled close to his side.instead, he just embraced the feeling and let happiness override the doubt that screamed in his mind.under the strong, warm jets of the jacuzzi tub, megan's pain started to fade.of course, as much as she tried to relax, it was too hard considering that pesh was in her living room.she couldn't believe that he had shown up out of the blue to check on her.just when she thought he couldn't be any kinder or more attentive, he did something like that.tilting her neck on the foam headrest, she thought about her talk with kristi the day before.she hated to admit it, but she knew she had a choice to make.she either had to let go of pesh, or she had to make things official with him.they couldn't just keep dating and hooking up... or was it just hooking up?with a frustrated groan, she shifted in the tub, sloshing the water around.closing her eyes, she tried to search her heart for how she truly felt.no man had ever made her feel like felt with pesh, and that could be said both inside and out of the bedroom.gazing down at her pruning fingers, she knew it was time to get out of the tub.she could stay there for days and still not have the answer she so desperately sought.after she toweled off and wrapped herself in her terry cloth robe, she went out into the bedroom.as she threw on a fresh pair of pajama pants and a t-shirt, she noticed it was awfully quiet in the living room.wondering what mason and pesh could be doing, she ducked out of the bedroom.the sight across from her on the couch made her chest clench with emotion.reaching up, she clutched her t-shirt over her heart, trying to still some of the ache that burned there.with the strains of despicable me playing in the background, pesh lay on his back with mason on top of him.her son's face was snuggled into pesh's chest, and he was sound asleep.they both were.pesh's face was tilted down, his nose pressed into the strands of mason's hair.before she could harden herself to the emotions coursing through her, tears stung her eyes.in that moment, she allowed herself to fantasize that this was truly her life.she had a loving husband who adored her, and her son had an attentive and doting father.what more could she ask for in life?in those minutes of weakness, she wondered why she had been fighting pesh so hard about a relationship.besides her own happiness, there was nothing more in the world that she wanted than for mason to be safe and happy.as she came crashing back to reality, she saw things clearly for the first time in a long time.pesh had been so worried about her that he'd driven over just to check on her.she'd never had a boyfriend who cared about her that much, and no matter how hard she searched in the future, she was probably never going to find another man like pesh.there were so many things about him that she liked... maybe even loved.he made her want to get up in the mornings, so she could see him at work.she found herself anxiously checking her phone to see if she had a text from him.she loved spending time with him.but it was more than just the feelings that pesh felt for her or that she felt for him-it was the fact that he cared so much about her son.they were a package deal for any future man, and he had willingly embraced that fact without complaint.on shaky legs, she walked over to the couch.as she stood over the two of them, she couldn't help reaching out her hand and tenderly touching pesh's cheek.he stirred at the contact.when his eyelids fluttered open, she smiled at him."hi."his gaze spun around the room like he was trying hard to remember where he was.when he glanced down at mason, realization washed over his face."sorry.i didn't mean to fall asleep.""it's okay.i'm sure you needed it.besides, i took too long in the tub."he smiled."i would argue that you need it as well."bending over, she slid her hand under mason's stomach while the other went under his legs.she hoisted him up and into her arms.when he whimpered, she murmured, "shh, mommy's going to put you to bed.""night, night, pesh," mason mumbled drowsily."good night, little man," pesh replied.once she had tucked mason in and kissed his cheek, she closed his bedroom door and returned to the living room.pesh sat hunched over on the edge of one of the couch cushions, as if he were planning to leave as soon as she came back."is he okay?"he asked.she nodded."out like a light the moment i put him down.""good."when he started to stand up, she pushed him back down on the couch.easing down onto his lap, she wrapped her arms around his neck.he brought his hand up to rub lazy circles over her back.she didn't speak for a few minutes.instead, she just enjoyed being close to him, the feel of his hand on her, his strong, muscled thighs beneath her."thank you for coming over tonight."his brows rose in surprise."are you sure?i was afraid i was overstepping my bounds."raking her fingers through his dark hair, she shook her head."i think we need to talk about our boundaries.""oh?"she nodded."you coming over here tonight made me realize something very important.what we've been doing has been fun, and i've enjoyed every minute of it.but now-" pesh's dark eyes snapped shut, and the expression on his face shifted as if he were in pain."please.you don't have to say this.i'll just go.""but i don't want you to go," she argued."then what are you trying to say?""that i need you in my life, and i want more."his brows shot up."more?as in more of us together?""yes."he sucked in a breath."you want us to be an official couple?"she smiled."yes, i do.well, everywhere except work.""i can't believe it," he murmured."this isn't exactly the reaction i thought you would have," she teased."oh, i'm happy.trust me.i'm just shocked, that's all."she brought her lips to his and gave him a tender kiss.against his lips, she murmured, "can you ever forgive me for being so stubborn and so stupid?""i can try.but i suppose you're going to have to work very hard to make it up to me.""am i?"he nodded."yes, very hard.""why do i have the funny feeling that your idea of me making it up to you is entirely different than mine?""no more orgasms for dates.just dates.""i can handle that."a wicked gleam flashed in pesh's eyes."the first date will be to the fox to see an opera."she groaned."you don't play fair."he ran his hands up her sides, causing her to shiver."i would have to argue that you haven't been playing fair all along.now it's my turn.""are you going to punish me?"she questioned in a whisper."mmm, hmm, there will lots of dates and lots of time spent together."he quirked a brow at her."a true hell on earth."she couldn't help giggling."i'll be a good girl and take it.""i'm glad to hear it."as they lapsed into silence, megan's fingers wound through the hair at the base of his neck."do you want to stay the night with me?"pesh's brows furrowed as if silently questioning her proposal."but you-" "no sex.just sleeping.""you think that's a good idea with mason?""we're a couple now.he's going to be seeing a lot of you."pesh smiled."yes, he is."staring into his eyes, she asked, "so you'll stay?""it would be a pleasure."without another word, she rose off his lap.after he got up off the sofa, she took him by the hand and led him to her bedroom.as she sat on the edge of the mattress, she watched as pesh stripped down to his boxer shorts.when he was finished, he walked slowly over to her."i'm sorry we can't do anything else."he brushed the hair out of her face and cupped her cheeks."i don't mind.i'm happy just to be with you."in her heart, she was happy as well and not just about him staying the night.but for how everything between them had worked out."so am i," she murmured before lying back on the bed."so am i."chapter eighteen for megan, the next few weeks flew by.she didn't know if it was because she was so busy at work, or it was because she was so happy being with pesh.she liked to think it was the latter.or maybe it was that she was busy being with pesh.on her off days and his, they spent every second together.most often, he came to her house.they made dinner together or they went out.although her parents didn't entirely approve, he slept over as well.what they didn't know is that some nights nothing illicit even happened between them.exhausted from the day's events, they merely enjoyed lying in each other's arms.as she came out of a patient's room, she glanced up to see pesh standing across the hall talking to another doctor.for just a moment, his gaze met hers, and although no one else could have possibly noticed it, she saw the longing and the affection.she gave him a brief nod before walking on to the nurses' station.since they had become a couple, their time at work had become almost a game of wills to pretend there was nothing going on between them.most days, it was harder than megan could have ever imagined not to burst out in a smile whenever she saw him or to resist the urge not to wrap her arms around him.but somehow they made it work.in the end, the pent up emotions that were suppressed during the day made for a lot of heated fireworks in the evenings.megan's thoughts were interrupted at the buzzing of her phone.when she glanced down at it, she grinned.it was pesh.it killed me not to be able to kiss you a moment ago.i know.me too.dinner at my place tonight?u cooking?she questioned.yeah.indian food.mmm, sounds good.what time?"7.does mason like indian food?megan eyed his text thoughtfully.the last three times she had been with pesh, mason had been with them as well.pesh never seemed to mind, but megan wanted a night with just him.a true date night.not sure.will get my parents or papa to babysit.you don't have to do that.i know.i want to.okay.see you at 7.bye.she had just slipped her phone back in her pocket when she was ambushed by kara.since the day she'd seen kara grope pesh in the hallway, megan had loathed the sight of her.she had managed to keep her distance from her at work, but lately, she noticed that kara had been creeping around, staring at her."can i do something for you?"megan asked politely."yeah, for starters, you can drop the sugar sweet act.i know how you feel about me."megan fought the urge to roll her eyes.instead, she crossed her arms over her chest."fine.what do you need kara?"kara glanced around them before she spoke."i want you to back off of pesh.""excuse me?"narrowing her eyes, kara said, "i know you're into him.i can see it in the way you look at him... it's in the way he looks at you, too.and i don't like it.""well, i'm terribly sorry that you don't, but frankly, i don't see how any of that is any of your business.""oh, he is very much my business considering we've been together.""um, okay.whatever," megan replied, feeling slightly shattered by kara's proclamation.in the rational side of her mind, she knew there was no way pesh could be involved with kara.but at the moment, it was the irrational side that seemed to be winning out over whether pesh was truly hers.kara jerked her chin in the air."besides the fact of what pesh and i are to each other, i'm sure it would be very interesting business to your professor.last time i checked, a nursing candidate wasn't supposed to get involved with a doctor.bad for one's reputation.""are you threatening me?"after a casual shrug of her shoulders, kara replied, "just stating facts.you don't impress me as one of those bimbo girls who likes to be used by a man for sex, which i'm afraid that's exactly what pesh is doing with you.but more than not wanting to be a sex toy, i imagine you wouldn't want to do anything to harm your future career.""i'm not discussing this any further," megan muttered, as she started past her."i won't be either as long as you stay away from pesh."without giving kara a final glance, megan continued walking down the hallway.she didn't know where she was going, but she knew she wanted to put as much distance as she could between herself and kara.the rest of the day she felt haunted by kara's words.more than anything, she couldn't wait until she could be alone with pesh to talk to him about it.pesh jerked his head up at the loud bang behind him.the garage door leading into the kitchen was thrown open with such a force that it rattled on its hinges.megan stalked into the room, her mouth turned down in a determined frown.she threw her purse down onto the floor beside one of the bar stools.with a frustrated breath, she blew back a few errant strands of blonde hair that had escaped the loose knot at the back of her neck."bad day?"he asked, with thinly veiled amusement.she glared at him."yes, as a matter of fact it was.""what happened?""well, where do i start?when i went to drop mason off at papa's house, there was a woman there with him."pesh's brows rose in surprise."patrick is dating?""he claims she's-" megan paused to make air quotes with her fingers, "just a friend.but i don't buy it."as he stirred the rice, he glanced at her over his shoulder."would it be wrong if he were dating?"a long sigh escaped megan's lips."no, he deserves to be happy.my nana has been dead for six years, so it's not like he raced out the moment he was free and started going through women like kleenex."pesh chuckled at her summation."did you not like her?"crossing her arms over her chest, megan replied, "that's the other part.she seemed really nice.and mason loves her.i guess she's been there before when he stayed with papa."after abandoning his place by the stove, pesh placed his hands on the marble countertop and leaned in close to megan."it sounds to me like patrick has found a good woman who loves him and his family.i don't think you could ask for a better scenario."she stared into his eyes for a moment before she smiled."you're right.i don't know why i got so upset about it all.""because as much as you love your grandfather, you're still protective of your grandmother's memory.""you're so wise," she murmured."it comes with age," he replied, with a wink."whatever."he gave her a quick kiss on the lips before returning to the stove."so besides patrick's new lady friend, what else happened to get you so upset?"when megan didn't reply, pesh turned around."what else is it?""you need to have a serious discussion with kara."his brows rose in surprise."i do?""yes, you do.""megan, you do remember that i'm not in charge of nurses."she rolled her eyes."yes, i realize that.but you are in charge of your dick, are you not?""excuse me?"crossing her arms over her chest, megan said, "kara seems to think that the two of you are an item."pesh chuckled."oh that's nonsense.we're just friends from working together."megan narrowed her eyes suspiciously at him."you've never seen her outside of work?"this was one area of questioning he hadn't bargained on ever having to answer.the truth was something he really didn't want to admit to megan.carefully choosing his words, he replied, "we got together for drinks a couple of times after work a few months back.i hardly think that categorizes us as an'item."'"it must be enough for her to think she can tell me that you're only using me for sex."pesh winced at the words.he would have never taken kara for being someone who was jealous.he put down the spatula and turned off the stove.he knew he couldn't go forward without coming clean."megan, i haven't been honest with you.""what do you mean?"she asked."i told you that kara and i had only had drinks a couple of times.but that isn't the whole truth."megan's eyes widened."what are you saying?"defeated, his shoulders drooped a little."after the night of noah's baptism, i couldn't get you off my mind.i wanted to prove to myself that i wasn't so enamored by you.so after having a couple of drinks one night, kara and i went to my car and fooled around.""you got drunk?"he gave a mirthless laugh."that is what is most shocking to you in what i just told you?""did you think i would be mad at you for messing around with some woman when we weren't dating?""yes," he answered honestly.megan shook her head."what you did then was your business.i mean, i'm not thrilled to hear that you fooled around with her, especially since you wouldn't sleep with me when i asked you to.""but don't you see the difference?i cared for you, and i cared nothing for her.we were barely in the car fifteen minutes if that tells you anything."the corners of her lips tugged up in a small smile."i really don't need the details of how much you didn't enjoy yourself."he ducked his head."i'm sorry.i shouldn't have said that.""but at the same time, i'm glad to hear that you won't be going back for a repeat performance."jerking his gaze up to meet hers, he replied, "never could i do that.""and you really were trying to get me off your mind?""yes, i was.""in a warped way, that's very romantic," she teased."i'm glad you think so," he mumbled."look, it's not the fact that she said you were using me for sex that has me so upset.""it's not?""she threatened me."pesh's eyes narrowed."physically?""not exactly.she said that if i didn't watch my back, she would report me to the dean."a low growl erupted from pesh's chest."she seriously said that?""yes, she did.""i'm sorry that her jealousy and spitefulness is rearing its head.i never imagined she was such a person when i... well, when i got involved with her.i'll make sure to speak to her.no one should have to work in a hostile environment, and she must understand that just because of her seniority, she is not allowed to harass you."pesh watched megan fidget on her feet while nibbling on her bottom lip."do you not want me to speak to her?""no, that's fine.it's just..." "is there something else?""you know how much i like you.i mean, the very fact i agreed to date you shows how much i'm committed to you."pesh crossed his arms over his chest."i'm thinking there's a'but' coming that i'm not going to like."megan sighed."but at the same time, whatever it is that is happening between us..." she swallowed hard."i've worked really hard in school, pesh.i don't want anything on my record that could hurt my chances of getting a job."if she was the crying type, he would have sworn her eyes shimmered with tears.he came around the counter to pull her into his arms."hey now, don't you worry one bit about getting into trouble.anyone who has seen you in action on the floor knows what a talented and gifted nurse you are."she sniffled."if there's even a rumor of me having an affair with an attending physician, i could be blacklisted."pesh pulled away to grip her chin in his fingers."after i speak to kara, you will have nothing to worry about, okay?"he could tell that even though she wanted to relax and let go of her anxiety, she couldn't."come on.let's fix you up."she wiped her eyes."what do you mean?"with a wink, he went over to the cabinet and got down a wine glass.then he poured some white wine into the glass before setting it down on the bar."take that."megan glanced at the glass and then back at him."are you trying to ply me with wine?""maybe."she leaned forward and picked it up.he watched as she couldn't resist the temptation and she took a hearty gulp.closing her eyes, she murmured, "that's so good.""i'm glad you like it."he walked around the counter again.this time he took her free hand."come on.""where are we going?""for part two of your relaxation."megan smiled at him before he began tugging her down the hall.when he got into the bedroom, he noticed her sigh of frustration when they bypassed the bed for the bathroom."while i finish dinner for us, you need to soak in a nice, hot bath.""you spoil me," she protested with a smile.he gave her a playful wink before turning on the bath water.once he got the temperature right, he turned back to her."bubbles?bath salt?"she raised her brows."don't tell me you actually have those?i mean, i know you're a metrosexual but really?""we all have our secrets," he replied.he didn't have the heart to tell her that he had kept some of jade's bath and body works stuff.he might've tried to bury them under the bathroom counter to get them out of sight and out of mind, but they were still there.he rummaged around to pull out a vanilla bottle as well as a peach.he held them up to megan for her approval."hmm, vanilla.""good choice."it was the one scent that didn't remind him of jade since she never used it.he poured a healthy cupful under the water, letting the foam magnify."ready to get in?"megan glanced down at herself before looking back at him."well, i seem to still be dressed."pesh cocked his head at her."oh really?i can help you with that."he took the wine glass from her and sat it on the counter.his fingers came to the hem of her shirt.without taking his eyes off of hers, he jerked it up and over her head.he gazed down at her simple, white bra.she sucked in a breath when his fingers skimmed her abdomen before he gripped the waistband of her scrubs and tugged them down.she stepped out of the pants, standing before him in only her bra and skimpy thong.taking her by the shoulders, he gently turned her around.his fingers trailed down her back to the clasp of her bra.once he unhooked it, he brought his hands up to slide it off her shoulders.unable to resist the softness of her skin, he bent his head to kiss along her back.as he dropped the bra to the floor, his hands skimmed up her ribcage to cup her br**sts."mmm," megan murmured, letting her head fall back against his chest."i'm only supposed to be undressing you," he argued, as he let her br**sts fall free of his hands.she immediately picked them up and brought them back to cup her flesh."i like the way you undress me.it's very relaxing."rolling her puckered ni**les between his fingers, he was rewarded with her gasp of pleasure."the water is getting cold," he warned."i'm getting so hot, i can warm it up."he chuckled against her ear before taking his hands away from her.as she whined in protest, his fingers jerked her thong down over her thighs.she raised her feet to step out of the underwear."all right.get in.""tease," she muttered, before walking over to the tub.he only got to admire her na**d backside for a moment before she lowered herself into the tub and disappeared under the foam.leaning back against the wall, she closed her eyes in bliss."this feels amazing.""good.""but you know what would feel even better?""what?"her eyes popped open, and she smiled invitingly up at him."if you were in here with me.""really?""mmm, hmm.""i should be finishing dinner," he argued, feebly.megan eyed the growing bulge in his pants."i think you should be in here letting me finish you."he threw his head back and laughed."fine.you drive a hard bargain, my lady."he quickly unbuttoned and took off his shirt.then his fingers went to the button and zipper on his pants.he slid them and his boxers down and stepped out of them, leaving him naked.megan didn't take her eyes off him the whole time.he shifted them in the water, bringing megan up to straddle him, but she was facing away from him."what are you doing?"she asked.he brought his hands to her shoulders and started massaging the tense muscles."helping you relax."she ground herself against his erection."i was hoping a couple of orgasms would do that instead."he chuckled."don't you believe in foreplay?""yes, but not when i'm this horny."bending his head, he let his warm breath tickle her outer ear."you, my love, are never going to be a candidate for tantric sex.you will never allow yourself to enjoy delayed pleasure and release.""i want to try-honest, i do.""but just not this evening, right?"one of his hands abandoned her shoulder to slide down in between her legs.she gasped as his thumb rubbed against her clit.as he continued stroking her with his thumb, he pushed two fingers into her slick passage.megan whimpered and thrust her h*ps against him.pesh kissed and licked her wet neck and back as he pumped his fingers in and out of her."does that feel good?""yes, oh yes," she murmured.he increased the pressure of his thumb, and megan shrieked, bucking her h*ps faster and faster against his fingers.when his other hand cupped and kneaded her breast, she cried out and came, her walls clenching against his fingers.once she finished shuddering, she collapsed back against him."feeling better now?""a little."she twisted her body around to where she was facing him."i want you inside me the next time i come."she rose up and then took his erection in her hand.while keeping her eyes on his, she guided him into her core.slowly, she sunk inch by inch on him.when she was fully seated, they both moaned at the feeling.at the intensity of what he felt inside her, pesh was thankful she had taken him up on the birth control script where he didn't have to use condoms anymore.she brought her hands up to his shoulders, and then she began to ride him.his hands came to grip her waist as his head bent forward to suckle one of her ni**les into his mouth.his teeth grazed the bud before his tongue flicked and teased it into a hardened point.throwing her head back, megan's walls tensed and convulsed around him.he knew he had a long way to go before he was going to come.once she recovered, megan panted as she started riding him faster, causing the water to slosh around them.as his mouth latched onto her other breast, megan threw her head back and moaned."harder," she urged.pesh continued sucking her nipple as he began to thrust his h*ps up in time to meet her movements.each time he went a little deeper, and it caused megan to be more and more vocal.she tugged at the strands of his hair and clawed at his chest as she strove harder and harder for her orgasm."please, please," she panted, as her hands came to cup her own br**sts.as she pinched and tweaked her own ni**les, it was pesh's undoing.shoving his hand down between her legs, he flicked her clit, sending her over the edge again.her movements caused him to jerk once and then come in her.once he finished shuddering and came back to himself, megan stared at him with an utterly satiated expression."that was... amazing.""thank you.""where did a nice boy like you learn to f**k?"pesh chuckled at her choice of language."you know, a person's reputation has nothing to do with how they are in the bedroom.i'm sure there are many tough biker dudes out there who wouldn't know a clitoris from a labia-if they even knew that terminology.""hmm, i suppose that's true.my ex liked to think he was a ladies man, but half of the time, i had to take matters into my own hands if i was going to finish."she shot him a wicked grin."thankfully, i have a lover now who has the most amazing tongue and dick.i never have to worry about coming now.""and don't you forget how amazing he is."her expression turned solemn as she replied, "i could never forget his attributes both in and out of the bedroom."he smiled."i'm glad to hear that."after he gave her a somewhat chaste kiss, he asked, "how about we test out my kitchen attributes now?""sounds good.i'm starving," she replied, as she climbed out of the tub.pesh followed her out, handing her one of his plush towels.after she finished drying off, he gave her a terry cloth robe to put on.she slid it on and tied the front together."wait here.i'll bring it to you.""dinner in bed?that would be marvelous."he winked before heading out of the bedroom.he fixed two heaping platefuls of food.after putting the plates on a tray, he got two bottles of water out of the fridge.when he got back to the bedroom, he found her lounging back against the pillows with an expression of pure relaxation.after he set the tray down on the bed, he smiled."i want to try something with you.""what is it?"she asked.he undid the ties on his robe, letting it fall open.after shrugging it off his shoulders, he stood na**d before her.megan's eyes widened."what are you doing?"without answering her, he climbed onto the bed.his hands went to the lapels on her robe.he opened them and then pushed the robe open to her waist."i thought we were eating dinner," she murmured huskily."we are."while her brows furrowed in confusion, he passed her a plate and a fork.then he took his."pesh, why are we eating dinner naked?""i want to teach you about delayed gratification.""the tantric stuff?""yes."she eyed him curiously."okay.""look into my eyes," he commanded.when her blazing blue eyes were trained on his, he brought a forkful of food to her mouth."open up," he said.her gaze held his as her tongue darted out, tentatively tasting the spicy rice.when she decided that she liked it, her mouth clamped over the fork.as she chewed, she still remained staring at him."feed me," he insisted.she momentarily broke their eye contact to stare down at the plate.she speared a piece of lamb before bringing it to his mouth.after he took in the bite, his tongue slid over his lips, licking up the remaining sauce.something stirred in her at his action-a slight tremble.he brought a piece of lamb to her mouth, and she wrinkled her nose."i don't like lamb."he nodded and then took the bite for himself.he then picked some of the vegetables and brought them to her.this time she took the forkful."it's very good, pesh.""i'm glad you like it."each time she took the fork into her mouth, he couldn't help imagining that it was his c**k instead.sitting na**d with her in such a close proximity had his juices beginning to flow.when she lowered her gaze to eye her plate for his next bite, she caught sight of his growing erection.immediately, she started to put her plate down, but he stopped her."not yet.""but you're hard, and i'm getting wet sitting here with you staring at me like you're already buried inside me.""that's the point, my love.how good do you think it's going to be when i do finally get inside you?""oh," she murmured.as she swept up a forkful of rice, she brought it to his mouth."so how long do we do this?"she asked."until we clean our plates."she appeared both disappointed and frustrated at his response.to give her something else to focus on, he brought the fork to her mouth.she took from him, chewing methodically while staring into his eyes.each time he fed her a bite, he tried conveying through his gaze what he was imagining doing to her.a bite of vegetables had him sucking her breast, his tongue flicking over her nipple.a forkful of rice had his face buried in her wet core as he licked her juices.as she chewed and swallowed, pesh could tell desire was overtaking her."can i have some water?"she asked.with a nod, he brought one of the bottles to her lips.she drank in long gulps, her eyes never leaving his.when she finished swallowing, she gave him a grateful smile.then in a flash, she tackled him, causing his plate to flip over onto the sheets."megan!"he cried.she was too busy kicking out of her robe to care.at the sight of smeared vegetables and rice on the sheet next to him, he began to laugh.his chest shook so hard that he wanted to clutch his stomach, but megan's body was in the way.as she gazed down at him, he pushed the long, blonde strands of hair out of her face."i don't believe we were finished eating," he chastised.she drew his bottom lip between her teeth, causing him to groan.at the same time, her wet core ground against his cock."i guess you'll just have to punish me the next time," she replied.cupping her bu**ocks, he sent a resounding smack against one of her cheeks.her eyes widened."pesh nadeen, did you actually just spank my ass?"he grinned up at her before smacking the other cheek."mmm, i like this side of you," she murmured, before bringing her lips to his.as their tongues battled against each other, pesh flipped megan over onto her back.after spreading her legs, he buried himself deep inside her with one thrust."oh god, that feels amazing," she cried."see how much better it is when you wait?"he questioned, as he leisurely moved in and out of her."yes, mmm, it's so good.you're right."although her body trembled, she wasn't close yet.he continued his pace of slow strokes within her.then he took her legs and put them on his shoulders to where he could pump deeper inside her.she moaned at the feeling, her hands sliding up above her head to grip the sheets.pesh ducked his head to bring his mouth to her br**sts, alternating between each one.as he felt her begin to tense up, he increased the pressure of his tongue on her ni**les, lightly grazing them with his teeth.and then she came apart beneath him, crying out and clasping her hands onto his shoulders.the sight of her was so alluring he couldn't hold back, and he came in a rush inside her.when he'd finished shuddering, he raised his head to gaze down at her.her eyelids fluttered open, and then she smiled sheepishly up at him."sorry for being a tantric sex failure."he laughed."baby, i don't care about that one bit.i like the fact you're aggressive when it comes to f**king."her hands feathered over his back and down to his ass.as she squeezed his cheeks, he sucked in a breath."you're very good at that.""you think so?""mmm, hmm.""how good are you at laundry?"he asked, motioning to the leftover dinner that was now staining the sheets.she swatted his ass playfully."i was planning on taking care of that.""why don't we get dressed and then sit down and really eat?""i think that sounds like a good idea.""good.i want to make sure you're feeling your best for what i have to ask you."as he pulled himself off megan, her brows furrowed."what is it?""can't it wait until we finish eating?"rolling her eyes, megan said, "you know i can't wait for things."pesh sighed as he bent down to pick up his robe.as he slid his arm through the hole, he met megan's questioning gaze."i wanted to invite you to dinner at my sister's house this weekend.""okay, i think i can do that."tilting her head, she eyed him suspiciously."why did you think i would need to be feeling my best for that?""it won't just be my sister and her husband.all of my family will be there, including my parents."megan's eyes widened."you want to introduce me to your parents?""yes, i would."she nibbled on her bottom lip as she was prone to do when she was nervous."but that would mean we're pretty serious, right?""yes," he replied, with utter certainty.scooting to the edge of the bed, she gripped her gaping robe as best she could.she stared up at him."you're not the least bit worried what they're going to say about you dating me?""no, i'm not."the corners of her lips tugged up in a smile."then i'll go," she said softly."really?"when she bobbed her head, he rushed forward to wrap her in his arms."thank you, my love.you've made me very happy.""you make me happy every day.it's the least i can do."with her head buried in pesh's chest, she was finally able to let the smile she had plastered on fade into a frown.while she should have been elated that pesh wanted to introduce her to his family, she couldn't help feeling overwhelmed.what if they hated her?what if their dislike caused pesh to not want to see her anymore?she didn't want to think about what it would be like not having him in her life.at the same time, it was hard processing all the emotions that pesh's devotion made her feel.davis had never wanted to introduce her to his parents.she met them by accident after one of his games.now she had a man who wanted nothing more than to share all aspects of his life with her.it was hard to process.in the end, she could only hope that everything went well.chapter nineteen the following day at work when pesh found a lull in patients, he stepped into the nurses' station.while he said hello to some of the other men and women of the nursing staff, he had a singular focus of getting to megan.when he joined her at the counter where she was doing paperwork, she jumped like he had tasered her."go away," megan hissed.he chuckled."you know, i think i can be seen back here in the nurses' station without arising any suspicion.after all, i could be discussing a patient with you.""then you better start talking in patient codes very soon.""i wanted to know if it would be all right to pick you up at seven on friday evening?"when megan jerked her gaze off the chart she was working on, her blue eyes bulged in horror at him.in a low voice, she said, "i can not believe you are talking about a date here at work.do you care anything about my reputation?"he held his hands up defensively."i'm sorry.i don't know what i was thinking besides the fact that i missed you and wanted to talk to you."megan's expression softened."i'm sorry, but we can't be that way here."pesh opened his mouth to protest when a voice behind them cut him off."don't you two look cozy," kara mused.pesh whirled around to find kara staring at them with venom burning in her eyes."excuse me, but i need to get another chart off the carousel," megan said, with her head tucked to her chest.she turned to go, but kara reached out and grabbed her arm."if you don't mind, exam room three needs a clean-up.""kristi is the only one authorized to give me orders around here," megan replied.kara pursed her ruby red lips."insubordination and sleeping with a doctor-you really have a career death wish, don't you?"megan started to protest, but pesh stopped her.glaring at kara, he said, "i want to talk to you.alone."after shooting megan a triumphant look, kara let pesh lead her out of the nurses' station and down the hall."what in the hell do you think you're doing?"he demanded."saving you from making a huge mistake.you don't need a girl like that-you need a woman to take care of you."when her hands started to snake up around his neck, pesh grabbed them."don't touch me!"he snarled.a sultry smile spread across her face."you liked when i touched you before.""that was one time-a drunken mistake that i regret daily, and i never intend on making again."she narrowed her eyes at him."so you're throwing me aside for a young bimbo?""do not speak that way about megan ever again.do you hear me?""and do you really feel that she thinks you're worth throwing her career away for?"pesh closed the gap between them.looming over kara, his entire body shuddered in anger."listen to me when i say that if you threaten to expose megan one more time, i will make life a living hell for you.as the supervising physician over the er, i can have you shipped off to some hellhole far from here."he glared down at her."do you understand me?"she slowly nodded her head as the realization that there was nothing between them finally dawned on her."if you'll excuse me, i need to go clean my exam room."as she hurried past him, pesh exhaled a breath of relief.he never used that tone of voice with women, or men for that matter, unless he was absolutely pushed to do so.but kara's previous behavior and the way she'd acted today had forced him to become what he wasn't.at the feel of a hand on his back, he whirled around.megan gave him a beaming smile."my hero!"he laughed at her expression and words."you don't have to worry about her harassing you or me for that matter.i took care of things.""i heard you."he grimaced."you did?"she nodded."it was amazing.""i'm glad you thought so.""i've never had a man take up for me like that before."pesh shook his head."that's a shame.""if we weren't in the middle of the er's hallway, i'd kiss you to show my gratitude."he smiled."i'll gladly take a rain check.""oh you will?that's good to know."lowering his voice, he said, "i'll expect that kiss later tonight when we're alone.and i don't just want it on the lips."his brows rose."i want it on several places on my body."megan grinned."i think that can be arranged.""i'll be looking forward to it.""dr.nadeen?"a nurse called from the top of the hall."yes?""you're needed in rxam room four.""as soon as i finish this patient consultation, i'll be there," he replied.at his blatant lie, megan covered her mouth to hide her giggling."i have to go.but can i come over tonight?""yep.let me get mason fed and bathed, and then i'm yours.""see you later."he winked at her before he turned and started down the hall.a few nights later pesh found himself speeding along the quiet streets of megan's neighborhood.his phone dinged once again.slowing down, he took a peek to make sure it wasn't the hospital.he wasn't too surprised to find it was another text from megan.he could tell from the way she had been frantically texting him that afternoon and evening that she was nervous, which was totally surprising to him.she was so strong and fearless that it was hard for him to imagine her ever feeling nervous.but he supposed that in megan's mind she had good cause to be nervous as tonight he was introducing her to his family.after he picked her up, they were going to his sister, shveta's, house for dinner.his parents, along with at least one of his brothers, would be there.although he had spent a lot of time with her family, it hadn't quite meant the same thing as her spending time with his.he didn't know if her nerves stemmed from simply meeting his family or if they were from the fear of how far their relationship had progressed in the last few months.he turned into the driveway at ten after seven.he didn't even get up the front porch steps before the door flew open, and megan rushed out.her diminutive figure wobbled a little on the black high heels she was sporting.she wore black pants, and a dressy red top that had a lot of beading.it reminded him of the kurta, a style that women from his culture wore.he wondered if she had chosen it for that reason."you look beautiful," pesh murmured, leaning in to kiss her tenderly.when she didn't warm to his touch, he gazed down at her."what's wrong?"rolling her eyes, she snapped."duh, i'm really nervous.""you're really that worried about my family's opinion of you?"she threw up her hands."of course, i am.your family is very important to you.i don't want..." she tore her gaze from his."you don't want what?"he pressed."i don't want to bring shame to you."he bit down on his lip to keep from laughing at her.he couldn't believe megan was so concerned with his family's opinion.his heartbeat accelerated at the thought.it had to mean she really was falling in love with him.he brushed a silky strand of blonde hair out of her face."sweetheart, you're not the first american girl i've brought home with me.""yes, i'm well aware of that.i'm also aware of the fact of how well your family loved and accepted jade.it might not be the same way with me."she stared up at him."i'm not like her, pesh.i'm not meek and good-hearted."he shook his head."that's not true.you are good-hearted.i see that part of you each and every day."cupping her chin with his fingers, he brought her gaze to his."you saw my brother, dev.through all of his missteps and antics, my parents still love him very much.so i promise you there is nothing you can do to where they won't like you or where you'll bring shame on me.okay?"she gave a reluctant nod."okay."taking her by the hand, he led her off the porch.once he'd gotten her in the car, he went around and slid into the driver's seat.when pesh cranked up the car, megan gasped in horror."what?"he asked.she motioned to the clock on the dash."oh my god, we're going to be late.can i make a worse first impression?"pesh laughed."maybe i should tell you a few things, etiquette wise, so tonight will go a little easier.""what does that have to do with us being late?""because it's considered good form to arrive thirty minutes late.""seriously?""yes.""huh, i didn't know that.""well, how could you?""i tried doing a little research.i even watched monsoon wedding," she said.pesh laughed."did you now?""yeah, it was pretty good.i kinda hated there weren't more dance numbers and songs.""megan, i'm pretty sure none of my family is going to break out into song like in a bollywood movie tonight," he said, with amusement ringing in his voice.she rolled her eyes."i didn't expect them to, smart-ass."he tsked at her."so testy tonight."after exhaling a long breath, she gave him an apologetic smile."i'm sorry i'm so bitchy.""you're not bitchy.""and you're lying.""regardless of your out-of-control emotions, i know that my family is going to love you just as much as i do."the moment the words left his lips he grimaced.there was the big l word.they hadn't actually exchanged it yet, and now he'd managed to screw up and say it before he could find the right time."oh god, did you have to say that now?like i'm not nervous enough!""i'm sorry," he murmured.burying her head in her hands, she groaned."this is... you are... i...""look, you don't-" "i love you, too!"she shouted from behind her hands.his hands jerked on the wheel, and he sent the car careening onto the emergency lane.when he recovered and got the car back into the right lane, he dared himself to look over at her.she peeked at him through her fingers."i love you, pesh.i really f**king do.""oh megan," he whispered.pulling her hands away from her face, she gave him a genuine smile."i love you more than any man i've ever known.""i love you more-" suddenly he found himself unable to continue.did he love her more than he had jade?he had spent years with jade and had only months with megan.if he did love megan more, what did that say about his relationship with jade?she reached over and took one of his hands in hers."hey, you don't have to say what i said.our situations are completely different."he clenched and unclenched his jaw."no woman wants half a man's heart," he argued."but i know it isn't half your heart.and i wouldn't want you to stop loving me just because i died, so why would i expect you to do the same with jade?""it's not fair to you," he croaked."life's not fair, baby.you have to get used to that one."she squeezed his hand."besides, i know what i feel when i feel your love.there's no half about it.you love me with all your heart and soul.""i do.i honestly do."unfastening her seat belt, she lunged over to kiss him.when she started to deepen the kiss, he had to pull away."hey now, you got ta stop that or we're not going to make it to my parents."she giggled and then eased back down into her seat.she managed to behave herself the remaining five minutes.when he pulled into his parents drive, he saw it was already crowded with cars.the sight of so many people set megan off, and she began tapping her fingers nervously on her leg."ready?"he asked, as he turned to her."as i'll ever be," she muttered.he shook his head as he got out of the car.like always, he opened her car door and helped her out.as they started up the sidewalk, megan was a flurry of movement.she smoothed down her hair and then she adjusted her top.then she fiddled with her purse on her shoulder."quit fidgeting," pesh whispered, as he rang the doorbell."i can't help it.i'm nervous."he grinned down at her."megan, they're going to love you.i promise."she shook her head."they're going to hate me because i'm not a submissive indian woman.wait until they hear i had a child out of wedlock.they'll be ready to disown you then."the door flew open, cutting off the rest of their conversation."brother, it's so good to see you!"his brother-in-law, sanjay, cried.after he hugged pesh, his gaze went to megan.his eyes widened, and he gasped in surprise."uh, hello.""hi," megan said.sanjay gave pesh a curious look."you didn't tell me you were bringing company.""this is megan."with a self-assured tone, he added, "she's my girlfriend.""really?well, what about that?"sanjay gave megan a welcoming smile."we're so glad to have you.""thank you," megan replied.as sanjay turned to go into the living room, megan smacked pesh's arm."you didn't tell them you were bringing me?"he shook his head."no, i like the element of surprise when it comes to my love life.""s-seriously?"she sputtered."it's better this way.trust me."before she could say anything else, pesh started taking off his shoes.wide-eyed, megan watched him.quickly, she stepped out of her heels and put them in the pile next to his."more etiquette you forgot to tell me?"she hissed.he patted the small of her back."you're fine."as they came into the living room, pesh felt megan tense at his side.he supposed that it was overwhelming coming into a room packed full of strangers.his sister, shveta, came forward first."hello brother.you're looking well this evening.""thank you.so are you."he hugged her tight.as he pulled away, he glanced down at her swollen belly."and how is the future prince doing?"shveta smiled and brought her hand to her abdomen."he's busy kicking me at the moment."when she spied megan behind him, she gasped."and who is this?"he drew in a breath and gazed around his family."before i go through this with each and every one of you, i might as well get it out of the way.i want to introduce you to someone very special, my girlfriend, megan."deafening silence reverberated around the room after his statement.his mother and father exchanged a glance before staring back at pesh.megan tucked herself even closer to his side.although public displays of affection between men and women were frowned upon in his culture, he wrapped his arm around her waist."well, say something," he commanded."we're sorry, son.it's just you caught us off guard," his mother said.his father's bushy brows rose."so you're really dating, eh?""yes, i am."at his declaration, his father clapped his hands and grinned."that is most wonderful to hear!"he came forward to embrace megan."you are very welcome here.""thank you," she said."i'm charlie," his father introduced."megan," she replied, with a small smile.pesh peered past his father where his mother stood chewing her lip.he could tell she wasn't entirely happy that another blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman was standing beside her son.while shveta and arjan had both sought out indian partners to marry, he and dev were somewhat the black sheep since they hadn't chosen to settle down with women within their culture.finally, his mother's manners won out over anything else, and she stepped forward to shake megan's hand."i'm lavani.it's nice to meet you.""nice meeting you, too," megan replied.the room then fell into an awkward silence.pesh glanced around, willing someone to say something.his mother cleared her throat."i'll go and finish up dinner."as she started into the kitchen, shveta followed her, along with arjan's wife.since it was customary for women to be in the kitchen, pesh found it to be only megan left with the men.it didn't go without her notice either."should i go and offer to help?"she questioned, in a whisper."sure.that would be nice."her expression told him that she really didn't want to leave his side, but she did anyway.once she was out of earshot, pesh found everyone's eyes on him."what?"charlie chuckled."you even have to ask, my son?""so ask your questions and get it over with before megan comes back in here," he replied, as he collapsed onto the couch.he faced a barrage of questions about where they met, how long they had been seeing each other, and how serious was it.he mustered as much patience as he could to answer them all.when he was finished, the men sat back in surprised silence."i never thought i would see the day," his father mused.sanjay shook his head."oh, i knew the day would come.i saw that when he was out with emma."charlie's brows furrowed."emma?"pesh pinched his eyes shut and wished his brother-in-law didn't have such a good memory."just a friend."with a snort, sanjay replied, "you certainly didn't look at her like she was a friend, even if she was pregnant.""you were with a pregnant woman?"charlie asked."alpesh how could you?"his mother demanded from the doorway."how could i what?"pesh asked.lavani's expression was horror stricken."get a woman... In the family way."pesh rocketed off the couch.he glanced past his mother to where megan stood."you're...?"he couldn't even form the words.megan's face flushed blood red."no!of course, i'm not!"lavani gave him a confused look."not her," she replied, pointing at megan."this emma that sanjay speaks of."bringing his hand to his forehead, he rubbed furiously to try to ward off the ache that was starting to pound in his head.everything was getting shot to hell so fast."first of all, emma and i were never intimate.she was pregnant by the man she is now married to.yes, i took her to the opera with sanjay and shveta, but there was nothing really between us."he shook his head and couldn't help wondering if he would ever have to stop explaining what had happened between him and emma."second of all, could everyone just back off for a second?i mean, you're not exactly giving megan a very good impression of our family."a nervous laugh erupted from megan's lips.she covered her mouth with her hand, trying to hide her giggling.he winked at her, and she lowered her hand to smile at him."fine, fine.now that we've cleared all that up, why don't we eat?"lavani suggested."that sounds wonderful," charlie replied.as they made their way into the dining room, pesh went to megan's side."you surviving okay?"he whispered."i'm hanging in there.i may need a drink when we leave.""just no silver tequila for you," he mused.without the others catching her, megan smacked his arm."ass," she hissed under her breath.he chuckled as he held out the chair for megan."thank you," she said before sitting down.he then eased in beside her.as the dishes began making their way around the table, he felt megan kick him.when he glanced at her in surprise, she whispered, "where is the silverware?""we eat with our hands.""seriously?""yes."he leaned over to whisper in her ear."but don't use your left hand because it's considered rude."she jerked back to stare wide-eyed at him."i'm left handed," she protested.he fought the urge to smile at her horror.he could tell that she would rather die than do something to embarrass him in front of his family."you'll be fine.they won't expect as much out of you since you're american.""alpesh, whatever is it that you're whispering about?"lavani asked, narrowing her eyes at him."i was just telling megan what a wonderful cook you are.she loves indian food, so i'm sure she's in for a treat."pesh squeezed megan's knee under the table.she cut her eyes over to him and smiled.once the plates had been passed around and everyone served, they began to eat."mmm, the samosa is delicious," megan complimented."thank you," lavani replied, with a beaming smile.as his mother turned her attention to shveta, pesh bowed his head and spoke in a low voice to megan."once i tried bribing beau with some samosa."she laughed."you did?why?""i was at aidan's house checking on emma when she was on bed rest.i guess you could say he didn't like me invading his turf.""would he not take it from you?""oh, he took it, ate it, and seemed to enjoy it.but i didn't make any friends that night."megan grinned."good old beau."pesh raised his brows."you're siding with the dog?""in that scenario, yes.he was merely protecting emma and noah.""i see."tilting her head at him, she added, "besides, i don't like any scenario where you and emma are anything more than friends.""i was there in a medical capacity," he argued.she wagged her finger at him."you brought dinner with you.that fact alone shows you were there for more than just practicing medicine."when he quickly pushed her finger down, she gave him a look that was a cross between puzzled and infuriated."are you trying to silence me?""no, i'm just helping you save face.we don't point-it's considered rude."megan's eyes widened."i've done something else wrong now?""you're fine."she shook her head."next time, you better plan on giving me a crash course in indian culture before you even think about bringing me around your family."across the table from them, shveta cleared her throat.when pesh and megan glanced at her, she smiled."you're doing fine, megan.please don't worry about following all the rules of our culture.we certainly don't expect you to."megan returned shveta's smile."thank you.i would never dream of doing anything to offend you.""of course you wouldn't," charlie replied.pesh didn't dare sneak a peek at his mother.after all, she was the one who upheld the traditions and customs of their heritage while his father had tried to americanize himself as much as possible, right down to changing his name.charlie dabbed the corners of his mouth with his napkin."i understand you have a son, megan."she smiled."yes, mason is almost two.he's my entire world.""you should have brought him with you this evening.we would have loved to meet him," shveta said."maybe next time.of course, after you see how much energy he has, you might change your mind."as the table laughed, she glanced over at pesh."mason truly adores pesh, and pesh is so good with him.his patience is infinite."pesh smiled."he's a good boy.i enjoy spending time with him.""so it's serious between you two?"lavani asked."uh, well-" megan began before she was interrupted by the doorbell.sanjay rose out of his chair."that must be dev.""how surprising that he's so late?"shveta mused with a smile.pesh almost laughed at the horrified expression on megan's face at the mention of dev."you didn't tell me he was going to be here!"she hissed."i wasn't sure if he was coming or not.but don't worry.things are fine between us now."megan gave him a skeptical look as dev walked into the dining room."hey everybody," he said, throwing up a hand.at the sight of megan sitting next to pesh, dev's eyes widened."well, well, if it isn't miss right hook," he mused with a smirk."it's miss left hook, actually," she corrected.dev grinned."good to know.""you've met megan, dev?"lavani asked curiously."we had the pleasure of meeting each other one day when i went by the hospital to see alpesh."at megan's sharp intake of breath, dev winked at her.he then eased down across from them and began piling food on his plate."so you guys work together and now you're dating, huh?""yes," pesh replied.after taking a bite of his samosa, dev motioned at them while he chewed."alpesh is sort of your boss, right?"pesh could feel megan's anger rising."no, actually he isn't.i have a preceptor, or head nurse, who is my boss.and before you can make it sound any seedier, it isn't against the hospital rules to date each other.besides, we met each other long before i started working at wellstar.""is that right?"dev replied."yeah, it is."a slow grin slunk across his face."i like you," he said to megan."you have an interesting way of showing it."charlie chuckled at the head of the table."my, my, alpesh, haven't you picked a feisty one?"pesh glanced at megan, who had flushed the red color of her blouse.she gave charlie a weak smile."i apologize."with a tsk, charlie replied, "please don't.it's been rather refreshing to see you putting dev into his well-deserved place.i understand you punched him, too."when his mother gasped in horror, megan fumbled under the table for pesh's hand.he squeezed it reassuringly as she ducked her head."um, well, i'm sorry to say that i did.""in megan's defense, i totally deserved it.i punched alpesh and said some really shitty things.""dev!"lavani cried.in true dev fashion, he rolled his eyes at his mother's outrage."we're fine now.everyone calm down."he met pesh's gaze."i'm happy for you, brother.you've made a good choice."he cut his eyes over to megan."i hope you both will be very happy together."pesh was taken aback by the sincerity in both dev's words and his expression."thank you."megan nodded."yes, thank you."dev leaned back in his chair, clasping his hands behind his head."and now to ensure that my news overshadows any excitement brought on by the two of you, i'd like to announce that i'm getting married next month-" lavani once again gasped in horror.but dev wasn't finished."and i'm going to be a father."pesh's mouth gaped open as the table erupted in absolute pandemonium.he wondered if his mother was going to pass out.turning to megan, he found her with her napkin over her mouth.from the way her shoulders were moving up and down, he could tell she was laughing.he leaned over to whisper in her ear."guess we're off the hook, huh?"she grinned."yeah, i think we're good.""i love you.""i love you more."chapter twenty now that he and megan were an official couple who had said the "l" word, pesh no longer had days off where he had to wonder how to pass the time.he wanted to spend every waking minute with her and with mason, and she always made sure that they had time together.today found him at patrick's house, wedged on the couch between some of megan's male family members.just like at his parents, the women were all stationed in the kitchen, putting the finishing touches on sunday lunch.as soon as becky came in the living room and announced it was time to sit down, there was a stampede to the dining room.he followed slowly behind the others, searching for megan who he felt like was his lifeline in the crowd."where's aidan and emma?they're never late," angie remarked, as she sat a giant platter on the table.liz shrugged."they haven't called.we could go ahead and get started, and then they can start when they get here."john pulled out a chair."good.i'm starving."becky rolled her eyes."you're always starving.between you and percy, we're going to be eaten out of house and home."pesh hung back as the others started taking their seats at the massive mahogany table.regardless of how welcoming the fitzgerald's had been, he still couldn't help feeling like an outsider.megan came in carrying a plate of ham.after she deposited it on the table, her gaze searched the room for him.when she spotted him, she gave him the smile that always warmed his heart before crooking her finger at him.as he started to join her, mason came running in."get me, esh," he urged, holding his hands up.pesh grinned as he stooped over to pick mason up."are you hungry?"pesh asked."uh, huh.""are you going to sit with me or pesh?"megan asked."esh," he replied."is that okay with you?"megan asked."we'll be fine."she motioned for him to have a seat.just as they sat down, aidan appeared in the doorway of the dining room with noah in his arms."sorry we're late.""where's emma?"megan asked, as she took noah from aidan.with a grimace, aidan said, "she isn't feeling well.it seems that with this pregnancy she's having third trimester morning sickness.i told her i would stay home with her, but she insisted i come get a good meal.""poor thing.we'll fix her a plate for you to take home to her later on," megan said.aidan smiled."thanks.if she can eat it, i know she'll be grateful."patrick clicked his fork against his water goblet."is everyone here that's supposed to be here?"a chorus of, "yes," rang around the room."good.let's return thanks."pesh obediently bowed his head along with the others.when patrick finished, the dishes were passed around and food was served.it was certainly a lot different than how his family did it, but he still enjoyed being with megan's family.while mason ate off his plate, megan gave aidan a break by feeding noah, or more appropriately letting him drape her in food while he fed himself."you're a mess," megan said, into noah's carrot-and-corn crusted face.his response was to grin at her."i'm sorry, mister, but that cute little grin isn't going to work for me.""he's so stubborn," aidan said."a stubborn fitzgerald?i've never heard of such," becky joked across the table.aidan shook his head."i'm serious.he refuses to let me or em feed him, and then he ends up wearing more than he eats.""sounds like his father," angie mused.when aidan gave her an exasperated look, she said, "you were the exact same way.i don't think you ate a meal until you were two that mother didn't have to hose you off after you finished."aidan grunted."don't tell em that story.she already blames me enough for noah's stubbornness."megan smiled."let's hope that this next baby has emma's temperament.""like she isn't stubborn," aidan countered."much less than you are," megan replied.pursing his lips, he appeared to be surveying her words."you might have a point," he said, with a grin.after everyone finished eating, the adults lounged around the table talking and laughing while the kids went into the living room.both mason and noah wanted to go with the bigger kids."will you keep an eye on them?"megan asked percy."sure," he replied."i owe you, perce," aidan said, as percy took the boys by the hand.as he sat with his arm draped over the back of megan's chair, pesh enjoyed listening to the lively conversation around him.occasionally one of aidan's sisters would ask him a question or his opinion.he had always been naturally quiet, and when he got in the midst of such a lively bunch, he tended to be even quieter.he realized if he was going to truly fit in, he was going to have to speak up more.their conversation was interrupted by a shriek that came from the living room followed by a loud wail.aidan was out of his chair in a flash while megan was close on his heels.mason came running into the dining room."what happened?"pesh asked."noah got hurted."aidan reappeared in the dining room with noah in his arms."he's fine.he just fell down."taking noah's hand, aidan said, "here daddy will kiss the booboos away, okay?"noah sniffled and bobbed his head.once aidan finish with his hand, noah stuck out his leg.aidan smiled."okay."once he bent down to noah's leg and kissed it, he asked, "are you daddy's boy?""uh-huh."angie chuckled."that's not fair to do that when emma isn't here."as the others laughed, pesh glanced at mason.he was staring at aidan and noah with a contemplative look on his face.never in a million years could he have imagined what he would do next.mason crawled up into his lap and patted pesh's chest."esh mace's daddy.mace daddy's boy."conversation in the dining room silenced.without even looking up, pesh felt his skin singing under the burn of everyone staring at him and mason.there was no way he could deny the boy when he wore such an expression of happiness."yes, you're daddy's boy."a strangled cry caused him to snap his gaze from mason over to megan.wide-eyed and open mouthed, she blinked a few times as if she were trying to believe that what she was seeing was real.then without another word, she bolted from her chair and fled the room.pesh sat in a shocked silence for a few seconds trying to decide what to do.bending over, he whispered into mason's ear, "will you go back and play with the others?i need to check on mommy."when mason nodded, pesh gently sat him back down on the floor.after he raced out of the dining room, pesh finally glanced at the others."excuse me," he said, before rising out of his chair.he made his way down the hallway.he didn't have to look hard for megan-she was in the one bedroom with the door closed.he rapped lightly on the wood.when she didn't answer, he went ahead and opened the door.he found her sitting on the edge of the bed with her head in her hands.he went over and sat down next to her.tentatively, he put his hand on her back."i'm sorry for not setting mason straight and telling him i wasn't his daddy.he looked so happy, and i didn't want to hurt him."with her elbows braced on her knees, megan turned her head to look at him.tears streamed down her cheeks."you think i'm angry at you?"he nodded his head.she hiccupped a cry."oh pesh, you're so naive sometimes!"he jerked back at her words."excuse me?""just when i think i can't love you more, you go and do something like that."before he could process her words, she threw herself at him, kissing his cheeks and mouth.she straddled his lap and brought her hands around his neck."you really love mason, don't you?""of course i do.""you could see yourself really being a father to him?""yes, i could.but what-" she silenced him with a kiss.it was one that was laced with desperate emotions.he wrapped his hands around her waist and drew her closer to him.just as he was about to deepen the kiss, she pulled away."you love me too, don't you?""you should have no doubts on that one.""you love me enough to be a husband to me?"her question caused him to suck in a harsh breath.he felt like he had been kicked in the gut."yes, i could-i always have."she tilted her head at him and smiled."then marry me.""excuse me?"bringing her lips to his, she murmured against his mouth, "marry me.make me your wife."at that moment, he thanked god he was sitting down because if he hadn't been, he was pretty sure he would've done something totally emasculating like fainting.he also questioned both his hearing and his sanity.had megan just proposed to him?surely, he was hallucinating."did you just ask me to marry you?"he questioned lamely.giggling, megan nodded her head."i wish you could see your face right now.i should be insulted.""i'm sorry.it's just you surprised me."she cupped his face in her hands."i'm sorry i don't have a ring, and i didn't get down on one knee," she lovingly teased.he brought his hands up to touch hers."you're really serious?""yes, i am."bowing his head, he tenderly kissed the tops of her hands."i love you so much, megan, and i want nothing more than to make you my wife.""so is that a yes?""i just want to make sure you know what you're saying.one minute you're in the dining room, laughing with your family, and then the next you're in here weeping and then proposing to me.and let's not forget how adamant you have been the entire time i've known you about being too young to get married."megan's lips turned down in a pout."can't a girl change her mind?""yes, of course, but i just want to make sure this is really what you want."tears sparkled in her blue eyes."you are everything i could ever want in a man.you love me, you watch out for me, you want the best for me.while that would be enough to make me want to marry you, you love my son.you watch out for him and you want the best for him.i couldn't ever imagine loving someone more than i do you.i can't imagine wanting to be anyone else's wife but you."she sniffled."i was so stupid for so long.i couldn't believe that someone like me could truly deserve someone like you.but you never gave up on me.if you give me the chance, i'll spend the rest of my life trying to make you happy."pesh couldn't stop the racing of his heart.he was sure both his heart rate and blood pressure were off the charts at this moment.he cupped her cheeks."nothing in the world would make me happier than for us to get married.""so we're engaged?""yes, we are."when a smile lit up megan's face, he shook his head."but not formally yet.not until i put a diamond on your hand.""but i don't need that to know i'm promised to you and that we're getting married.""maybe you don't, but i do."she rolled her eyes."fine, fine.i'll let you buy me a diamond.a great big one, okay?"he laughed."i promise to spend a fortune.""you know i would be happy to wear your ring even if it was a little chip.""i know you would.but i want to spoil my beautiful future wife."she grinned."okay, i won't argue with you."pesh brought his mouth to hers.as their lips moved against each other, he couldn't believe how lucky he was.megan was his-she was really going to be his for the rest of his life.when she flicked her tongue against his, he groaned into her mouth.considering they were at patrick's with all of her family down the hall, he knew the last thing on his mind should've been flipping her over onto her back and pounding into her.but he didn't care.he wanted inside her body.he had finally made it into her heart, mind, and soul, and he once again wanted to be inside her perfection.when megan pushed him onto his back, pesh raised his brows at her."mmm, i think my future wife is getting ahead of herself.usually the consummating comes after the wedding, not the engagement," he teased."i think we've consummated enough over the last few months where it doesn't matter.""i suppose you're right."as she ground her core against his growing erection, she said, "looks like i'm not the only one with consummating on the mind.""you should know that has a mind of its own."she grinned down at him."well, right now i think we're both of the same mind."as she continued to grind against him, his hands swept to her br**sts.he cupped and kneaded the flesh over her top.at the sound of the door opening, pesh tried to pull away, but he didn't make it in time."oh f**king hell!"aidan's voice boomed from the doorway.megan quickly scrambled off pesh, and they both rose up, trying to straighten their clothes and hair.with a pained expression, aidan said, "seriously?this is my old bedroom!"pesh chuckled."i'm sorry, but you of all people should understand that when the mood hits, you act on it."megan smacked his arm playfully."that is not exactly what happened."holding up one of his hands, aidan said, "frankly, i don't really want to know what happened.i just came back here to make sure megan was all right.next time, i'll make sure someone else comes, so i don't need eye bleach to wipe that out of my memory. ""ha, ha, very funny," megan grumbled, as she got off the bed."we were only celebrating," pesh said.aidan pinched his eyes shut."i don't think i even want to know what you were celebrating.""our engagement, pervert," megan replied.aidan's blue eyes widened."holy shit, you two are engaged?"pesh smiled as he rose off the bed and took megan's hand."yes, we are.well, i mean, i need to go to her father and properly ask for her hand.and there's the fact she doesn't have a ring."shaking his head in disbelief, aidan said, "that's... Wow.i'm so happy for you two.""thank you.and i do mean that.if it weren't for you and emma, i never would have met megan," pesh said.aidan grinned as he clapped pesh on the back."you're more than welcome, man.i'm just so glad you two finally realized how good you were for each other."he turned back to the door before motioning them."come on, let's go tell the others.i think this calls for a celebration, but just not the kind that you two were partaking in."megan shook her head."we weren't going to tell anybody yet."pesh nodded."she doesn't even have a ring."aidan snorted."do you really think anyone out there is going to give two shits about whether or not you have a ring?""we just want to do it the right way," pesh replied.holding up his hands in surrender, aidan said, "all right, i'm not going to argue with you anymore.but i will say that there is no right way.hell, look at me and em.in the end, you have to go with the flow and appreciate the moments that are bigger than you could ever imagine."he then turned and strode out of the bedroom.pesh stole a glance at megan who appeared to be processing aidan's words."come on, we better get back out there before they send someone else," she finally said.with a smile, he took her hand and led her down the hall.when they got back to the dining room, everyone glanced expectantly at them.even though he knew he shouldn't, pesh blurted, "we're engaged!"he didn't have time to worry about megan's anger about him blabbing because he realized she had said it at the same time he had.cheers went up over the room, and he was hugged and kissed by megan's aunts.when megan's father, paul, stood before him, pesh felt like he'd been kicked in the groin."mr. Mckenzie, i apologize.i intended to come to you and ask for megan's hand-to show respect to you and your wife.i'm so sorry."paul shook his head and smiled."please don't apologize.i'm just grateful that she's met such a wonderful man who will be a good husband to her and a good father to mason.""i swear to you that i will."he and paul shook hands to seal the vow.in the absence of champagne, wine was poured to celebrate.at the head of the table, patrick held up his glass."to my granddaughter and the good doctor, i give you an irish marriage blessing.'may god be with you and bless you.may you see your children's children.may you be poor in misfortunes and rich in blessings.may you know nothing but happiness from this day forward."'he smiled."to megan and pesh."the others raised their glasses.once pesh tasted the rich bouquet of the wine, he leaned over and kissed megan.he didn't even mind the cat-calls and whistling-he was too happy to care.chapter twenty-one standing in front of the lighted hotel mirror, megan surmised her appearance.it was the first time she hadn't been encircled by pesh's mother, sister, and aunts since she had stepped inside the suite an hour ago.when she had agreed to an indian engagement party, she hadn't quite known what she was getting into.she thought it would just be a great way to get their friends and family together.she didn't know that pesh's family didn't do anything on a modest scale.without her input, the plaza ballroom of the ritz carlton in atlanta had been booked.when she had dared a peek inside earlier, it had been transformed into something out of a bollywood movie.she had wanted to honor pesh's culture by dressing just as a true indian prospective bride would, so she had gone sari shopping with lavani and shveta.what she hadn't bet on was how gorgeously intricate the outfit would be.now as she gazed at herself in the mirror, she was almost blinded by the glittering stones and beading on the deep purple and gold sari.the outfit put even the blingiest miss america pageant dress to shame.the top part was sleeveless, and it ended just below her br**sts.while the front part appeared to be plain satin, the back was encrusted in beading and gems.the skirt, with its beaded waistband, started just beneath her belly button and fell to the floor in the most exquisite silky material.it was hard imagining she was going to be baring her mid-drift, as was the fashion of the sari.thankfully, she had a jewel encrusted drape that slung across one of her shoulders and down one side.earlier after one of pesh's aunts had done her makeup, lavani and shveta did her hair.the long strands were swept back and pinned on the side in loose curls.a gorgeous purple orchid adorned the curls.all that was missing from her ensemble was the jewelry that pesh's family had requested that she wear.apparently, it was all heirloom pieces and kept in a safe at a bank.although the necklace and earrings were to come, her arms were heavy laden with bangle bracelets that lavani and shveta had put on her.they both had tears in their eyes when they finished."you look absolutely breathtaking, my dear," lavani said.megan smiled."thank you.and thank you so much for making tonight happen."lavani cupped her cheek."i look forward to seeing many happy years between you and my alpesh.i'm grateful that you make him so happy.it had been so long since i had seen a light in his eyes.but when you came into his life, you brought back that light."at lavani's words, megan felt tears stinging her eyes."thank you," she murmured.when she felt like she could speak without crying, she brought her hands together as if she were praying and then bowed her head as was the sign of respect in pesh's culture."i want you to know that before pesh, i was in darkness, too.he has become my light as well.i can assure you that i will spend the rest of my life honoring him and making him happy.i am very thankful for the amazing man you have raised."lavani's dark eyes filled with tears, and she brought a handkerchief up to dab her eyes."thank you, my dear."shveta stepped into the bathroom, her face lit up in a broad smile."alpesh is here."gathering up the bottom of her skirt, megan walked out of the bathroom and into the bedroom.her heart stopped at the sight of him.she had never seen him in kurta-pajama, as they were called.basically, it was a long, tunic like shirt that came to his knees.underneath he wore loose cotton-like pants.but his top was made much like hers.it was gold in color and encrusted in gems and beading.she didn't want to begin to imagine how much it cost.when she brought her gaze back to his, she shivered under his heated stare."you are a vision of absolute and total perfection," he said.doing a little turn, the fabric of her sari twirled around her."so you like it?"he smiled."i love it."she laughed."i feel a little like a poser.like'you can put the irish girl in a sari, but you can't take the irish out of the girl' kinda thing.""i wouldn't have you any other way," he said, with a serious, yet tender tone."thank you."megan eyed the two velvet boxes in his hand."ooh, let me see the goodies."with a bark of a laugh, pesh sat one of the boxes down on the table before he opened the other.megan gasped as two enormous earrings glittered back at her.while there was a thick base, the rest flowed down in flourishing designs that would probably touch her shoulders when she put them on.they had a gold overlaying, but all the gems were diamonds and amethysts that would match her sari."this is why your mother and shveta wanted me to pick a purple sari?"she questioned.pesh nodded."they're breathtaking," she murmured."wait until you see the necklace," he replied, with a smile.her shaky hands reached forward to take one of the earrings.she quickly worked the clasp and fastened it to her lobe.then she did the other.while they were so heavy she felt like they might weigh her down, she glanced up at pesh and smiled."thank you.""you're welcome, my love."he reached for the other box.megan's eyes widened as the diamonds and deep amethysts sparkled in the light.he took the necklace out and unfastened the clasp.he moved behind her and then lifted the necklace over her head.she closed her eyes at the pleasurable sensation of feeling his closeness."there.now you're ready."whirling around to face him, she brought her lips to his."i love you."his thumb tenderly rubbed her cheek."i love you, too."from the doorway of the bedroom, lavani tsked disapprovingly at them."alpesh, stop mauling her, or you're going to mess up her makeup!"pesh chuckled."i hardly think i was mauling her."she waved her hand dismissively."come now.it's time we went downstairs."after pesh held out his arm for her, megan slid hers through his."don't be nervous," he murmured into her ear."i'm not," she lied."megan, i know you well enough by now that i know when you're nervous.you fidget and bite your lip.""sorry," she muttered, as they got onto the elevator.considering it was packed with pesh's family, megan kept her mouth shut about her nerves.the last thing she wanted to do was to come off wrong in front of them.when the doors opened, she drew in a couple of deep breaths to still her nerves.there was a whole lot of pomp and circumstance that she didn't quite understand about how they were all supposed to enter.she just tried not to mess up the part when she came in with her parents.just like at a wedding reception, she and pesh sat at a table at the head of the room.of course, she hadn't quite prepared herself for the golden chairs that looked almost like thrones.once everyone was assembled, pesh's father got up to speak."we are very grateful that you all could be with us this evening.i know that with megan's friends and family, as well as some of our son's, there are a lot of you unacquainted with our culture.i will try to explain to you what the proceedings are."on the table in front of them were two flower wreaths that reminded her of the leis that you would see in hawaii.they were in colors of white, gold, and purple.the wreaths crisscrossed over the black ring boxes.she knew from what pesh had told her that they would be giving each other rings tonight to symbolize their future union.it all seemed pretty extreme to her for just an engagement party-it was almost like a wedding."it's show-time," pesh murmured in her ear before he stood up.she quickly followed his lead.he took one of the flower wreaths off the table and brought it over her head.he made sure to adjust her hair so it flowed over the flowers.when he was done, she did the same, although it was a little harder for her to reach up over his head.then he took one of the platinum bands and put it on her trembling finger."i love you so very much, megan.there's not another woman in the world i could love like i do you," he whispered to reassure her."i love you so much, too."she then slid the band on his hand.once it was done, applause went out over the ballroom, and pesh pulled her to him for a kiss."now what do we do?"she asked.he smiled at her."we dance."after exhaling the breath she had been holding, megan took pesh's hand and let him lead her to the dance floor.a song she had never heard before in her life began to play from the dj."so what were you thinking when it came to the wedding?"pesh asked."something small."his brows rose in surprise."really?i was thinking you would want to go all out."she shook her head."i just want something simple with our closest friends and family.i don't have to have something showy to make me happy."he grinned."you know that anything'simple' is not going to set well with my parents."megan laughed."well, they're just going to have to accept it.""we could just run off and get married in a cave in hawaii," he suggested."that idea has potential, but i think as my parents' only daughter, they would kill me if they didn't get to plan something."his expression grew serious."i don't want us to have to wait much longer.""i agree.i want to get married in the next couple of months."he smiled."good.i'm glad to hear that."as megan glanced over to see her grandfather dancing with his lady friend, an idea popped into her head."what if we got married in papa's rose garden?""it sounds like a beautiful place, but is there enough room?""only our closest friends and family, remember?"she insisted."it could work.""so you like the idea?""i do."with a wink, he said, "it makes sense considering you proposed to me at patrick's house."megan grinned."that's right.it does.""think we can put it all together in two months?""i don't see why not."he brought his warm lips to hers, and megan shivered in spite of the heat on the dance floor."i can't wait to make you my wife," he murmured against her lips."i'm ready to make an honest man out of you, too."pesh threw his head back and chuckled."only you would say something like that.""hey, the truth is the truth."the song ended, and pesh escorted her back to their table.after they finished with the blessings from pesh's family, dinner was served.megan couldn't believe all the food that was paraded by her.she lost count on how many plates of delicious indian food she sampled.by the time the desserts came out, she was thoroughly stuffed and couldn't eat any."let's go mingle," she suggested when pesh also turned down any dessert."sounds good to me," he said, before getting out of his chair.they made their way through the maze of tables, talking to family and friends.megan was introduced to so many of pesh's relatives that she was sure she would never be able to remember them all.when they finally got to the fitzgerald tables filled with her parents and aunts and uncles, she was thrilled when pesh took a seat across from aidan and emma.after they had been talking for a while, emma turned aidan."do you think noah's okay?"aidan smiled."i'm sure he's fine, babe.the sitter looked very qualified."although emma nodded her head, megan could tell that she wasn't convinced.both mason and noah were upstairs in the hotel with babysitters outside of their family for the first time in their young lives.megan shared a bit of emma's apprehension, but when she had dropped mason off in the suite, he seemed to get along with the woman they had hired."i might just go peek in on him.you know, make sure she got him to sleep," emma said, rising out of her chair.aidan shook his head and stood up."you need to be off your feet.you said yourself you weren't feeling too well before we left."emma shot him a murderous look."thanks for saying that in front of pesh and megan."aidan gave them a sheepish grin."sorry guys.i hope it doesn't ruin your fabulous party knowing that emma, at nine months pregnant and some change, wasn't feeling wonderful."megan laughed while pesh shook his head."emma, if you want to go on upstairs and lie down, we won't be hurt.i remember how awful it feels being overdue," megan said."no, i'm fine.i want to stay," emma replied.when aidan motioned for her to have a seat, she shook her head."i need to go to the restroom.""you want me to go check on noah?"emma sighed."i'm sure he's fine or the sitter would have texted me.i'm just being overprotective."aidan gave her a quick kiss."love you, sweetheart."she smiled at him."i love you, too."after she headed through the crowd to the bathroom, aidan began telling pesh some wild story from work that had pesh doubled over with laughter.when emma returned, she didn't sit back down.instead, she swayed back and forth on her feet next to her chair."aidan," she said in a strained voice.megan couldn't help noticing how emma had paled considerably since her trip to the bathroom just a few minutes before.he held up his finger."one second, babe.i got ta finish telling pesh this story.""but my water broke."without taking his eyes off pesh, aidan slid his glass of water over to her."here take mine."if the situation hadn't been dire, megan would have laughed at how oblivious aidan was.pesh leaned forward in his seat."um, aidan, i think-" he didn't get a chance to finish.instead, water splashed against the side of aidan's face.he shot out of his chair before whirling around to emma."what the hell, em?""my.water.broke," she muttered through gritted teeth."oh shit," he replied.after tossing his napkin back on the table, he held up a hand."okay, it's fine.no need to panic.we're not that far from the hospital-" "like twenty minutes," emma argued.aidan's hands came to her shoulders."it'll be fine, babe.i promise."emma huffed out a few frustrated breaths as she weighed his words.then her grim expression softened."okay."aidan grinned as he turned back to pesh and megan."i hate to cut and run, but it looks like baby caroline is a big attention whore who wants all the glory tonight."megan rose out of her chair."don't you worry about it one bit.since she's a week overdue, i'm going to let her have this one without accusing her of trying to steal the limelight.""can we do anything?"pesh asked.while aidan shook his head, emma said, "just make sure noah is okay."angie rose out of her chair."i'll go check on him right now."emma smiled."thanks."aidan dug around in his pocket.when he produced a set of keys, he tossed them at pesh."since i came after work, em and i are in separate cars.whoever has noah overnight will need our suv to get him to the hospital tomorrow."pesh nodded as megan said, "good thinking.i'm not sure if mom is taking him or becky."at emma's somewhat apprehensive look that there wasn't a strict plan in place for noah, megan said, "it'll be fine.i promise.""okay," she said, a little reluctantly.sliding his arm around emma's waist, aidan said, "come on, sweetheart.we need to go."at the feel of pesh's hand on her back, megan glanced up at him."exciting night for them, eh?""yes, it is.""how about letting me take you for another spin on the dance floor?""i'd love that."as an indian love song flowed out from the speakers, megan wrapped her arms around pesh's neck.this time he didn't bother dancing more formally like he had in savannah.instead, he wrapped his arms around her waist and drew her flush against him.closing her eyes, she rested her head on his broad chest, loving the gentle beat of his heart beneath his shirt.when the song finished, they didn't move.they just waited for the next one.thankfully, it was another slow one.halfway through, she felt a tug on the bottom of her drape.glancing down, she saw georgie peering up at her."what are you doing, sweetie?"she asked.he glanced left and right before he spoke."mommy told me not to tell anybody, but she needs you to come up to her hotel room.""okay.what for?""noah's going crazy wanting aunt emma, and she thinks you're the only one that might be able to get him to calm down.""ah, i see."when she turned back to pesh, he smiled."you don't even need to apologize.go see if you can help."she leaned up and gave him a smacking kiss on the lips."thank you for being so amazing each and every moment of the day."his thumb brushed against her cheek."you're welcome, my love.""be back as soon as i can.""i'm going to hold you to that."taking georgie's hand, she made her way off the dance floor and out of the ballroom.after getting on one of the elevators, they rode to the sixth floor.she let georgie lead the way.he stopped halfway down the hall and knocked on the door.by then, she didn't have to guess which room noah was in.she could hear his screams all the way outside.when becky flung open the door, she waved megan through with her hand."the others didn't want me to interrupt you, but we've been trying the last hour to get him to calm down, and he's just not having it."megan found the scene in hotel room somewhat comical.her mother, along with her aunts julia and liz, stood in a circle around one of the beds.outfitted in a fuzzy, blue footed sleeper, noah sat in the middle of the mattress, his cheeks streaked and soaked with tears and his face red from crying."what is the matter?"megan asked.everyone whirled around to look at her."nothing.everything's fine.go back to your party," angie said, over noah's wails."um, i think it's safe to say that it isn't fine.or at least, he's not fine."liz fanned her face with her hand."it's like the moment emma left the hotel, he freaked out.he woke up out of a dead sleep screaming for his mama.the poor baby-sitter hung in as long as she could before she finally called us."megan cocked her head at noah."poor thing."she bypassed her aunts to hold out her arms.considering he'd spent so much time with her, noah happily reached for her, and megan pulled him into her embrace."hey buddy, you've got to stop crying."he was snubbing so hard his breath came in big hiccups as his chest heaved."mama.want mama," he pleaded pitifully.megan hugged him tight to her chest."i know, sweetie.but she's at the hospital having your baby sister."her answer didn't satisfy him since he drew in a deep breath to start screaming again.she smiled at him."you wan na go downstairs to the party?"he appeared thoughtful."pesh is downstairs.you wan na see him?""esh?"megan laughed."yes, he's down there.""see esh," he said, kicking his feet as if to tell her to start walking."here.i'll take him," her mother suggested, reaching for noah.he shrieked before wrapping his arms tighter around megan's neck."i think it's safe to say he's staying with me.""but it's your engagement party," julia protested."yes, and i've been enjoying it the last four hours.i don't think watching him is going to take away anything for me."as she started out the doorway, she asked, "is mason okay?"her mother nodded."thank goodness he's down the hall, or we'd have two toddlers running around at eleven o'clock."megan giggled as she walked down the hall.her necklace and the beaded sari seemed to be holding noah's interest."pretty, huh?"she asked, as they got on the elevator."ooh, pwetty," he mimicked.when she got back downstairs, pesh was seated at their table, talking to some of their colleagues.the moment noah saw him, he reached out for pesh."well hello, little one.were you really crying because you wanted to come to our party?"noah grinned at pesh behind his pacifier, which caused pesh to smile."he looks so much like aidan when he does that, doesn't he?""yes, he does.i'm sure he's going to use that cute little grin to his advantage when he gets older, just like his daddy did."she eased into the chair beside them.after spitting out his pacifier, noah asked, "daddy?""uh, oh, i shouldn't have said that," megan muttered under her breath."my daddy?""he's at the hospital with mommy.we'll take you there in the morning," she replied.that statement caused noah's lip to tremble.before he could start crying, pesh rose out of his chair."let's go look at all the pretty party decorations."megan smiled as she watched pesh take noah around the room.her heart warmed at his thoughtfulness.she couldn't believe there was ever a time when she fought her feelings for him.there wasn't a better man in the whole world, and the fact that he loved her was a true miracle.by the time pesh returned, noah had fallen asleep.he carefully sat back down beside her."here," she suggested, taking off her glittering drape.she wrapped the fabric over noah like a blanket."did i mention how much i loved you in a sari?"pesh questioned, with a wicked gleam in his eyes.she glanced down to see the top had her boobs bulging out the front as well as the fact her stomach was now bared."i'll have to wear one more often for you.""i would love that."when her phone beeped, she reached across the table and grabbed it."oh my god!""what?"pesh asked."that was aidan.the baby is already here.""considering it's a second baby, it isn't too surprising.""i need to tell my mom and aunts."he nodded."go ahead.we're fine."megan smiled at noah sleeping soundly against pesh's chest."be right back."she made her way over to her family's table."that was aidan.caroline was just born."a whoop went up around the table."is emma okay?"becky asked.megan nodded."he said mother and baby are doing great."julia shook her head and smiled."aidan with a daughter-now that's going to be something to see."they all laughed."that's so true," megan said.becky glanced at the group."why don't we go see them?i mean, the hospital isn't too far from here."angie nodded."sounds good to me.i'd personally like to see aidan in action with his baby girl."with a snort, megan added, "i would have liked to have been in the delivery room when she was first born.his expression then would have been priceless.""i bet he cried," liz said."oh yeah, he bawled for sure," angie replied, with a grin.as her aunts started gathering up their purses and telling their husbands where they were going, megan said, "i want to go too."before they could argue, she held up her hand."it's late.the party is pretty much over, and there's two more next week at some of pesh's relatives' houses.besides, i want to see the newest fitzgerald baby girl."her mother frowned."are you sure?""i'm positive.""all right.go tell pesh, and we'll meet you out front."she smiled as she went back to their table."my mom and aunts are going to the hospital to see aidan and emma.""you want to go?"her heart warmed at the fact that he already knew what she was feeling."do you mind?"he shook his head."of course not.can i go too or is this just a hen party thing for the women?"she laughed."yes, you can come."pesh glanced down at noah."he's going to want to see his mother.""oh yes.i don't think we could go without him."as pesh rose out of the chair, noah stirred but didn't wake up."get aidan and emma's keys out of my pocket."she nodded and reached into his pants.when she accidentally touched his penis through the fabric, he jumped."sorry about that," she replied, as she pulled out the keys."no problem," he muttered through gritted teeth.they said a quick goodnight to pesh's parents and other relatives who remained.then they headed out to the lobby.after giving the valet aidan's keys, they waited for the suv to be brought around.when she caught her reflection in the glass doors of the hotel, she gasped."what's wrong?"pesh inquired."the jewelry!i can't go loaded down with this expensive stuff to the hospital!"she cried.she snatched off the earrings and then started working on the necklace."i'll run go give it to your mother.""if you insist," pesh replied.she kicked off her heels so she could run easier.the necklace and earrings weighed down her hands.she grabbed the first member of pesh's immediate family she saw, which unfortunately happened to be dev."can you get these to your mother?i've got to get to the hospital."his dark eyes widened as he took the jewelry from her."are you okay?""i'm fine.a cousin's baby was just born.don't let anything happen to that, okay?"dev chuckled."yeah, i'll be unloading this pronto.the last thing i need is for my ass to be the one to lose the family jewels."with a wink, he added, "they'd be taking my family jewels."megan laughed and then gave him a wave before running off.when she got back outside, aidan and emma's suv had just pulled around.noah began to squirm in pesh's arms."guess where we're going?"pesh said, before he could start crying."mama?"pesh smiled."yes, we're taking you to your mama and daddy and new baby sister."noah's face lit up at the prospect, and he happily let them buckle him into his car seat.following her mother's car, they made the drive in almost a caravan of relatives.when they got to the hospital, pesh pulled up to let her out."i'll go park and bring him in.""okay.i'll see you guys up there."when she got up to the maternity floor, there was a quite a group waiting for her, including emma's best friend, connor."did casey not feel like coming tonight?"megan asked, as she hugged him.casey was just a few weeks shy of her own due date with a little girl.he chuckled."oh, she's here all right.she's just in labor herself.it seems like caroline and olivia are going to be true best friends by being born almost the same day."megan grinned."that's wonderful news."connor wrinkled his nose."i think casey will be appreciating it a little more when her epidural kicks in.she wasn't too happy the last time i went back to see her.""oh yes, i remember that feeling well."megan's phone dinged, and she quickly read the text."aidan says we can come back now," she said to her aunts.the group made their way through the double doors and down the hall.when they reached emma's room, angie knocked on the door.within a few seconds, aidan appeared."hey guys," he said, with a beaming smile."the nurse is actually checking on em, but give me a second."he disappeared back behind the door only to reappear within a few moments.this time he held a tiny bundle wrapped in a pink blanket."here she is.miss caroline elizabeth fitzgerald."collective oohs and aahs went up over the group as aidan held caroline out for them to see.she didn't seem too interested or impressed by them.she yawned and closed her eyes."she's absolutely beautiful," megan said."she's something all right," aidan murmured."there it is!i see a tear," becky teased.aidan rolled his eyes at his sister."let me guess.you had some kind of bet going about whether i cried or not?"liz patted his back."something like that."pesh appeared then.the moment noah saw his father he kicked to get down.once he got his feet on the floor, he ran to aidan, wrapping his arms around aidan's leg."hey buddy.you want to meet your sister?"squatting down, aidan held caroline to where noah could get a good look at her."mama's tummy baby?"he questioned.aidan laughed."yeah, this is your baby sister, caroline."noah eyed his sister with a slight frown, as if he was trying to figure her out.megan could only imagine what was going on in his head at the moment.he'd spent the last sixteen months being the center of his parents' world, and now there was someone else to share the attention.when caroline scrunched up her face and whimpered, noah patted her arm."no cwy, baby.""aw, he's going to be a good big brother," angie remarked.aidan chuckled."yeah, he'll be fine until caroline needs emma.then he's going to be ready to sell her to the gypsies."a nurse exited emma's room."you can go in now."as she gazed around the crowd, she shook her head."well, some of you can go in."rising up off the floor, aidan took noah's hand."come on, buddy.mama wants to see you."noah didn't bother waiting on aidan.he barreled through the door."mama!mama!"he cried.megan smiled as she watched him climb up on emma's bed."there's my baby boy!"emma cried hoarsely, smothering both his cheeks in kisses.he snuggled up to emma's side."come on, meggie.you and pesh come in first," aidan suggested.megan didn't argue with him.instead, she took pesh's hand and followed aidan inside.emma glanced up and shook her head."i'm so sorry for ruining your engagement party.""you didn't ruin our night," pesh reassured her."that's right.we kept right on partying-it didn't bother us at all," megan teased.emma laughed."i'm glad to hear that."megan smiled and jerked her chin over at aidan, who sat in the rocker with caroline."congratulations on a beautiful baby girl.""thank you," emma replied, as a beaming smile lit up her face."are you feeling okay?"pesh asked.emma nodded."it was a little easier this time and a lot quicker."she turned to aidan."and this time i didn't have to worry that aidan might not make it."aidan chuckled."no, you just kept screaming at me to drive faster because you were not going to deliver caroline on the side of the interstate."emma's cheeks flushed."i guess i was a little panicked."pesh took megan's hand and squeezed it."we better go and let the others have a turn," he said."do you want us to take noah back with us?"considering he was plastered to his mother's side, megan wasn't really looking forward to trying to take him.emma gazed down at her son with love burning in her eyes."no, i think he can stay here with us a little longer.i might get connor to take him home.i know he'll be here until casey delivers.""are you sure you won't need your rest?"megan asked."oh, i'll pawn him off to aidan and make sure i get plenty of sleep until miss caroline needs me," emma replied, with a sly smile.aidan didn't argue with her.he looked perfectly content to lose sleep if it meant being surrounded by his wife and children.after exchanging a few hugs and kisses, she and pesh headed out into the hallway and let the next group in.as they walked down the hall hand in hand, pesh turned to her and smiled."you know, i never thought i would see the day i would be envious of aidan again.""what do you mean?"he heaved a sigh."seeing him with his children makes me envious.one day i hope that's you with my child in your arms.""oh," she murmured.whether or not they would have children together had never really been discussed.it was almost a given that they would, so it didn't seem necessary to iron out when and how many.she wanted nothing more than to give pesh a baby of his own.he was truly the father mason had never had."give me a year," she said softly.his brows furrowed in confusion."what?""i'd like one year for us to be together as a married couple before we try to have children.""that only makes me an even older father," he protested."you'll be fine.you're awfully spry for your old age."he laughed."i just don't want to be on a walker at his or her high school graduation."she smacked his arm playfully."one year is not going to make that much a difference.""fine.you win.we'll wait one year."as the elevator doors dinged open, they stepped inside.gazing down at her, pesh said, "i couldn't have picked a more amazing mother for my future children.""yeah, i got ta agree that you did good, nadeen.real good," she teased.he cupped her face in his hands and gave her a lingering kiss that silenced anymore of her comebacks.when he pulled away, she smiled at him."keep kissing me like that, and i might decide to wait even longer for a baby.you'll make me want you, your lips, and your dick all to myself for as long as possible.""and here i thought my kisses might get you in the mood for baby-making," pesh mused.megan laughed."either way, it's a win-win situation.so bring it on, nadeen.bring.it.on."chapter twenty-two although her stomach screamed in protest to drop her fork, megan couldn't resist popping in the last bite of delicious crepe into her mouth.as she chewed, she closed her eyes at the delicious combination of chocolate and strawberries danced along her taste buds."good?"a voice asked from across the table.her eyelids popped open to take in pesh, her new husband of three days.he wore an amused smile as he held his cappuccino cup in midair."orgasmically good," she replied.he chuckled."i'm glad you're enjoying them.""i'm going to gain ten pounds while we're here," she replied.as she dabbed her mouth with her napkin, she sighed with absolute contentment.gazing around the tiny parisian cafe, she fought the urge to pinch herself.was she actually in paris on her honeymoon?when pesh had asked her where she wanted to go, there was only one place.although it was somewhat cliched for a honeymoon destination, she had always wanted to see the city.and because she was marrying a man who loved to spoil her, pesh had booked them for a week's stay at the hotel plaza athenee.not only had he chosen the hotel for its gorgeous views of the eiffel tower, but it was also where carrie bradshaw stayed when she was in paris.it seems pesh completely understood megan's love for sex and the city.their first day in the city had been spent in their hotel room.a combination of jetlag and lust had kept them na**d and in bed, stopping only for room service and showers.today they had pried themselves away from the room to go sightseeing."are you ready to go back to the hotel?"pesh asked."maybe."with a teasing grin, she asked, "are you tired and want to rest?"desire pooled in pesh's dark eyes."no, i don't want to rest.i want you to model what you bought this afternoon."her gaze left his to go down to the pink and black bag at her feet.part of their sightseeing had turned into shopping, in which she bought some very racy lingerie.although she was enjoying her day out in the city, she was also itching to put on the outfit and get back in bed with pesh."then let's go," she said.pesh certainly didn't need any more convincing.digging in his pocket, he took out his wallet and threw a wad of euros on the table.then he popped out of seat like a jack-in-the-box.she had to snatch up her purse and bag to keep up with him before he sprinted out the door and into the sunshine.as she passed the colorful flowers in bloom outside the cafe, they transported her back to her wedding.it had been a perfect, cloudless day when she stood with pesh in the rose garden at her papa's house.to her, he had never looked more handsome than in his black tux that fit his built frame like a second skin.since she was the master of party planning, megan had enlisted emma's help in getting the quickie wedding done.even with newborn caroline to tend to, emma had gone above and beyond any expectations megan had.tears had stung her eyes when she first caught sight of the garden as she, on her father's arm, made her way from the house to the ceremony.white chairs draped with blue silk bunting lined the garden in rows while a tent had been erected to the side of the makeshift altar.next to the chairs, votive candles lit the way up the aisle that was adorned in multicolored rose petals.emma, casey, and two of her best friends from childhood stood at the altar in their cornflower blue bridesmaid dresses.pesh, along with his brothers and aidan, wore blue vests with their tuxes.a string quartet struck up the bridal march to herald her arrival.she would never, ever forget the feeling of walking up the aisle to pesh.his loving gaze took her in, and she felt like the princess she had always wanted to be on her wedding day.her dress was almost like what a disney princess might wear-a long train, a full ball gown, a bodice encrusted with pearls and sequins, and then a glittering tiara holding her veil in place.the entire world seemed to evaporate when pesh took her hand in his.he was her only focus.she barely heard the words the priest spoke or the lyrics of the song that emma sang.she just stared at her soon-to-be husband-the man who made her believe in romance and true love.she was so lost in thoughts of her wedding day that she accidentally mowed into a woman."excuse me," she apologized.the woman scowled at her while cursing at megan in french.well, megan imagined it was cursing since she didn't speak french."where is that head of yours?"pesh asked, with a smile."thinking of our wedding day," she replied.his smile grew broader at her response, and in the middle of a crowded street, he stopped to kiss her.while it was somewhat chaste and full of more love than lust, it did hold a promise of what was to come later on.he ended it far sooner than she would like."let's hurry," he replied.she giggled before breaking into a slight run towards the hotel.he followed her example.by the time they pushed through the revolving doors into the lobby, they were both breathless.like two mischievous kids, they raced to the elevators.once inside, they wrapped their arms around each other and kissed passionately until the door dinged open.they pulled apart long enough to get down the hall and into their suite.when the door closed behind them, pesh pulled her to him, bestowing a lingering kiss on her lips.as he ravaged her mouth, his tongue darted inside to tease along hers.when she felt his evident desire poking into her stomach, she broke the kiss.at his groan, she shook her head."not yet.i have to get dressed.""next time," he muttered.pushing out of his arms, she grinned up at him."i'll be back in just a second.you get ready.""oh, i'll be ready.that's a promise."she laughed and then practically skipped into the bathroom.once she closed and locked the door, she sat the bag down and dug inside.after she decided what to wear, she laid them out on the counter, and then started taking off her clothes.when she was naked, she reached for the lingerie.the tight bodice was solid black with pink ribbons that wove through making intricate designs.it pushed her br**sts up and over the cups, making her appear to have far more cle**age than she was blessed with.the black and pink panties were lace and practically see through.on her legs, she slid black silk stockings that had pink bows at the tops of her thighs.as she fluffed out her hair, she couldn't help gazing in the mirror.she looked quite the sexpot, which she hoped pleased pesh.well, she knew it would please pesh.the man was ravenous for her, something for which she was very thankful.not quite the polite gentleman she had expected when she first met him, that was for sure.megan opened the bathroom door.across the room, pesh stood gazing out the window, stripped down to his boxer shorts.when she cleared her throat, he jerked his head to stare at her.slowly, she walked out of the bathroom.her eyes stayed on him.a shiver rippled through her as he tracked her every move.when she finally stood before him, it took less than a second for him to pounce on her.his hands grabbed her by the waist, jerking her flush against him.his mouth bore down on hers in a frantic kiss as he ground his c**k between her legs.breathless, she pulled away to gaze up at him."does this mean you like the lingerie?""oh hell yes, i do.i think we're going to have to go back and get you some more."she laughed."more shopping?you won't hear me say no to that."bending over, pesh brought his arm under her knees and then lifted her up.she felt so light in his arms as he walked her over to the bed and gently deposited her on the mattress.as he loomed over her, her heartbeat sped up in anticipation the sensual delicacies she was about to experience.tugging on the straps of the bodice, he bared her br**sts.his mouth hovered over her nipple, breathing warm air onto the cool tip.it puckered under his attention before his tongue darted out and flicked it."mmm," she murmured, her fingers tightening in his hair.making slow circles around her nipple, pesh continued his teasing assault.arching her back, she gripped the strands of his hair tighter, willing him to take her nipple in his whole mouth.finally, he obliged her, sucking the hardened peak into his mouth.while he gave oral attention to one breast, his hand palmed and stroked the other.as the heat and moisture built in her core, megan began sawing her legs back and forth.the friction eased her a little, but she wanted pesh's fingers, tongue, and dick there more than anything.over the fabric of her bodice, he kissed down her stomach.just as he reached the juncture between her legs, he bypassed it and began kissing and licking the exposed skin on her upper thighs.she groaned in protest.he gazed up at her with a teasing smile."did you want me to kiss you somewhere else?"raising her hips, she replied, "you know where i want you-where i want all of you.""patience, my love.""oh really?"she muttered.with one quick movement, she was out from underneath him in a flash.surprise filled his face as she flipped him over onto his back and straddled him once again.raking her fingernails down his chest, she stopped just at the waistband of his boxers.as his breath hitched, her hands went to his thighs, scraping a trail up the exposed skin to his dick.his h*ps bucked up, causing her to smile."oh, did you want me to touch you somewhere else?"with a growl, he gripped her by the ass and forced her onto her knees.he slid down the mattress to where her core was right at his mouth.his tongue flicked out, sliding along the thin scrap of her panties.she gasped as he flattened his tongue and rubbed it over her clit.even through the fabric, it lit her on fire.as he added more pressure, she began to rock her h*ps against his face.closing her eyes, she concentrated on the feel of tongue.when he pulled away, she whimpered.his lips came to kiss along her thighs again.just as pesh's teeth dug into one of the bows on her stockings, megan's ringtone for mason blared out over her frustrated breaths.pesh protested the interruption with a grunt, but immediately let the stocking fall from his mouth."i'm sorry.it's his bedtime call.i have to take it," megan said, as she sat up in the bed."it's all right, my love.i'm the one with patience, not you," he replied, with a smile.she rolled her eyes at him as she grabbed the phone off the nightstand and answered it."hey baby," she said, trying to catch her breath."hi mommy.miss you."her heart warmed hearing his tiny voice while an ache filled her chest."oh, i miss you too, sweet boy.are you being good for grammy?""uh-huh.pway with noah today.""did you?did you have fun?""uh-huh.but caowine cwies."megan laughed at his summation of the latest fitzgerald family member."i bet she does.she's a little baby, and they do like to cry.you cried a lot when you were that age.""where daddy?"glancing at pesh, megan smiled."he's right here.you want to talk to him?""uh-huh."megan handed the phone to pesh.his face lit up as he said, "hey buddy, how are you?"as mason rattled along to pesh, megan couldn't help thinking of how happy mason had been on her wedding day.he had played his part as ring bearer wonderfully.everyone commented on how handsome he was in small tux and how much he looked like her.he was so excited to have a daddy and to be part of a real family.he didn't even seem to mind that they were moving away from his grandparents into pesh's house.of course, pesh had sweetened the moving angst by having a black lab puppy, just like beau, waiting for mason in his new room.he had squealed so loud that megan thought her ear drums were going to burst."oh, so beau two pee-peed on grammy's rug, huh?"pesh asked, throwing megan an "oh shit" look.while they were away, angie was in charge of both mason and the puppy, who mason had aptly named beau two after his first love, beau.megan could imagine her mother was fit to be tied with her rugs being christened by puppy piss."okay, you better go to bed now.mommy and i miss you very, very much.we're bringing you lots of presents home."at mason's reply, tears shimmered in pesh's eyes."i love you, too, buddy," he replied, in a choked voice."say goodnight to mommy," he replied, thrusting the phone at megan.a sheepish expression came over pesh's face as he ground the moisture from his eyes with his fists.megan took the phone."night, night, mommy!"mason called."night, night, baby.you have sweet dreams, and i'll talk to you tomorrow.""okay.wuv you!"she smiled."i love you, too."after megan hung up, she still cradled the phone to her ear as if by doing that, she was able to have mason a little closer.pesh's hand came to rest on hers."he's something, isn't he?"he asked."yes, he is," she murmured."i know it makes me a complete pansy, but every time he tells me he loves, i can't help but cry."putting her phone back on the nightstand, megan eased herself over onto pesh's lap."don't you ever worry that i think you're a pansy because of what you feel for mason.it makes me love you even more."brushing her hand across his cheek, she added, "a man who isn't afraid of showing his emotions or his vulnerability is very sexy.""you think so?""mmm, i do."he smiled."i'm glad to hear you say that.""where were we?"glancing down at his crotch, pesh said, "i think we're starting over from my perspective."megan's hand went to cup his now deflated erection.she rubbed him over the boxers before dipping her hand inside to grip him.pesh hissed in a breath.his head fell back against the headboard as she started stroking his growing length.sliding down his body, she brought her hand to his lap and took him into her mouth.her tongue teasingly flicked across the tip.pesh's hand came to tangle in her hair.she did leisurely strokes up and down his length before bringing him into her mouth.as she began bobbing up and down, pesh's groans echoed through the room.as she cut her gaze up to him, he glanced down at her with hooded eyes."so good, baby.so, so good," he murmured.when he started tensing up, she let him fall free of her mouth."i want you to come inside me," she said, as she climbed up his body.rising up on her knees, she brought pesh's hands to the elastic band of her underwear.he tore them off her h*ps and down her thighs.somehow she managed to get them off and toss them to the floor beside the bed.leaving on the bustier, she guided his erection to her core.slowly, she eased down on him, inch by inch.when he was balls deep inside her, she sat back on his thighs.raising her knees, she placed both her feet flat on the mattress.from this position, she was giving pesh quite the view as she rose on and off of him.as the pressure began building inside her, the more frantic her movements became.harder and harder she bounced, the sound of skin slapping along with grunts and panting echoing through the room.when pesh's fingers came to tease her clit, she came undone, crying out and collapsing onto his chest.he continued raising his h*ps to pump into her until he came a few moments later.brushing the hair out of her face, pesh stared up at megan with a satisfied expression.she brought her lips to his for a gentle kiss."i love you, mr.nadeen.""do you?"she bobbed her head."i love you and your talented fingers and dick, all of who give me wonderful orgasms."he barked out a laugh."i've married such a naughty girl, haven't i?""yes, you have.""i wouldn't have you any other way, my love."megan smiled as he slid free of her body.easing her onto her side, pesh spooned up behind her, nuzzling his face in her neck."rest now," he said, drowsily."yes, you need your rest.i'm going to want more of you in a little while."his chuckle made her tingle with love and lust.with the feel of his arm wrapped around her, megan let her drooping eyes close and drifted off to a contented sleep.chapter twenty-three as they sat outside the courtroom waiting to be called in, megan adjusted mason's blue and white striped tie for the hundredth time."mommy, no," he pleaded.she snatched her hands away."i'm sorry, sweetheart.i'll leave you alone.""tank you," he replied, going back to his game on his tablet.the truth was her nervous hands needed to be doing something.sensing her need, pesh reached over and took her hands in his."relax.everything is going to be fine."megan wanted to believe him, but she couldn't help feeling anxious.she wouldn't be able to calm down until the ink had dried on the paperwork.her feet, encased in black heels, tapped anxiously on the floor.the clattering noise echoed around the atrium.as she glanced between pesh and mason, megan had to smile.the two men in her life looked almost identical today in their navy suits and ties.of course mason's was considerably smaller than pesh's.when the door opened and a clerk poked her head out the door, megan's heartbeat started thrumming faster and faster."megan nadeen?"she shot off the bench."that's us.i mean, i'm megan nadeen."the clerk smiled."you guys can come in now."taking a deep breath, megan reached for mason's hand."this is it, baby."he grinned and then glanced up at pesh."you be my daddy now?"pesh smiled."yes, i'm going to be your daddy for real now."they walked through the massive doors of the courtroom.the judge, in his ominous black robe, gazed down at them from his bench."good morning," he said, politely."g-good morning," megan stammered."i understand that we're here today to petition for the adoption of the minor child, mason patrick mckenzie?""yes," megan and pesh replied."first, we need to swear you all in," the judge said.megan went through the motions of the procedure, trying desperately to calm her nerves.when pesh had first broached the subject of formally adopting mason, she initially had been thrilled and honored.but then she had to worry about whether davis would allow pesh to adopt mason or not.although he still had nothing to do with his son, davis hadn't shown a lot of enthusiasm about the prospect.the closer they got to the adoption hearing, the more megan worried that he would refuse."dr. Nadeen, i understand that you wish to adopt the minor child of your wife?"pesh nodded enthusiastically."yes, your honor, i would.""i see that you and your wife have been married less than two months, and that you've only known her a year."the judge adjusted his glasses that had slid down his pointy nose."do you think it wise to legally bind yourself to this child after such a short time?"megan fought the urge to stalk up to the bench and smack the judge.instead, she took deep breaths and tried to reign in her temper.she glanced over at pesh who merely smiled pleasantly at the judge."your honor, i realize that on paper it might seem as though i am rushing into things.however, i've never been more certain of anything in my life as i am about my love for megan and in turn, my love for mason.i've waited a long time to be a father, and i don't want to have to waste another second.""i see."the judge eyed the folder open before him."i understand the biological father has had no contact with the child.""that's correct," megan replied."he has also waved his parental rights so that dr. Nadeen can adopt his son."megan exhaled a relieved breath that davis had signed the paperwork."i'm glad to hear that, your honor," she said."do you feel that your husband will make a good father for your son?""i never would have dated, least of all married him, if i didn't believe that pesh would be a good and loving father to mason.""so the fact that he is a wealthy doctor had nothing to do with it?""how dare you!"megan cried.when pesh grabbed her arm to silence her, she slung him away."you've known us for two minutes and you're making assumptions about me, my husband, and my marriage?if this were about money, i could have used his father for child support considering he is a wealthy nfl player.but i would have sacrificed everything to ensure that my son had a good father!""mrs. Nadeen, i will ask that you control yourself, or i will have to hold you in contempt," the judge said sternly.pesh wrapped his arm around her waist, drawing her against him."easy," he murmured.although she hated to do it, she said, "i'm sorry, your honor."when he smiled at her, she gasped in surprise."and i am sorry for rattling you, mrs. Nadeen.i often say or do unorthodox things to see the true nature of the people who come before me.""you mean, you said that to get a reaction from me?""yes, i did.and you unwaveringly rose to my challenge.i can see that you are truly concerned with the wellbeing of your son."still reeling from the judge's behavior, megan mumbled, "thank you."peering down over the bench, the judge surmised mason."son, do you know why you're here today?""i gettin"dopted," mason replied.the judge smiled."yes, you are.do you want pesh to be your daddy?""uh, huh.""do you want anyone else to be your daddy?""no," mason replied quickly, shaking his head back and forth."then come up here while i sign the paperwork."mason happily ran around the side of the bench to the judge.he climbed up onto the judge's lap.after signing several sets of papers, the judge handed mason his gavel."once you bang that gavel, pesh is officially your daddy, and you are mason nadeen."with a broad grin, mason brought the gavel down.tears stung megan's eyes, and she gladly let pesh pull her into his arms."thank you, thank you, thank you," she murmured."i love you," he replied, squeezing her tight."i love you, too."their attention was drawn to where mason kept banging the gavel.the judge chuckled."okay, i think that is enough.why don't you go to your mommy and daddy now?""tell the judge thank you," megan instructed."tank you," mason replied, before he hopped off the judge's lap and came running to them."i'dopted!i'dopted!"pesh bent down to pick him up."that's right, buddy.you're my son for now and always."megan smiled and patted mason's back as they started out of the courtroom."come on.let's go to papa's.we've got a big party for you there."mason's face lit up."ice cweam?"oh yes, there's lots of ice cream just for you.""yay!"he cried.when they drove up at patrick's, megan did a double take at the sight of an inflatable bouncy castle out on the lawn.john, percy, and georgie were already making good use of it."emma, the party planning monster has struck again," she mused.pesh chuckled as he got out of the car.he went to get mason while she started into the house.balloons and flowers filled the foyer and living room.over the dining room archway, there was a giant congratulations mason sign.when she got to the kitchen, she sucked in a breath at the sight of all the catering pans."emma fitzgerald, what have you done?"she questioned.at the sound of megan's voice, emma jumped.clutching her chest, she whirled around."okay, so maybe i found a really excellent deal on the bouncy castle.like ridiculously cheap."megan crossed her arms over her chest."the food?i thought mom and my aunts were cooking."holding up one hand, emma replied, "just williamson brothers bbq.nothing fancy.""anything else i need to know about?live band or celebrity bursting out of a cake?"emma giggled."nope.that's it."megan watched emma bustle around the kitchen, setting up the plates and cutlery."um, is there anything i can do?i mean, i feel pretty shitty considering this is my son's adoption party," megan said, with a smile.pink tinged emma's cheeks."i'm sorry."megan threw her arms around emma and squeezed her tight."don't be sorry.you're amazing to do all of this for us."emma smiled."you're more than welcome.i'm so happy for you and pesh and for mason.""thank you."when megan pulled away, emma said, "oh, there is something you can do.go tell aidan we're about to start.he went to get caroline up from her nap.""sure.i'll be happy to."as megan started down the familiar hallway, she stopped outside of aidan's boyhood bedroom.through the crack in the door, she could see him walking around the room, bouncing caroline in his arms.at the sound of his singing, she had to stifle a laugh.ankle was many things, but a singer wasn't one of them."sweet caroline, dum, dum, dum.good times never seemed so good," he crooned off-key.when megan pushed open the door, aidan jumped."um, hey," he said, a flush entering his cheeks."i never really pictured you as a neil diamond fan," she said, with a smile."yeah, well, sweet caroline seems like the right thing to sing to her."he cleared his throat."what are you doing in here?""emma wanted me to come get you.""oh," he said.in his arms, caroline began to whimper, her little fists flailed."shh, it's okay, sweet pea.where was i?""i've been inclined," megan answered him."right," he said, over caroline's cries.when he picked back up with the song, megan said, "that's really unfair to torture her like that."as aidan scowled at megan, caroline began to quiet.aidan's expression then turned triumphant."see?she likes it when i sing to her.""but you can't sing," megan protested.aidan shrugged."it doesn't matter to her."megan laughed."she has a mother with a killer voice, yet she likes to listen to you?"flashing his signature cocky grin, aidan replied, "what can i say?all women love me."with a roll of her eyes, megan said, "give me a break."glancing down at caroline, aidan said in a sing-song voice, "don't you have the sweetest, handsomest, and most wonderful daddy in the whole wide world?"caroline cooed at his question and kicked her legs."she's a smart girl because she knows how lucky she is.""you're terrible," megan said, with a grin.aidan looked from his daughter over to megan."you want to hold my most perfect little princess?""i would love to."she held out her arms as aidan passed caroline to her.outfitted in a frilly purple dress and purple bow, caroline looked like she could be modeling baby wear.unlike noah's strawberry blond hair, hers was a deep auburn.she had also inherited her mother's green eyes."i have to agree that you're a lucky girl because you look just like your mother," megan said.aidan laughed."yeah, she is a little mini-emma, isn't she?""she is.boy, she's going to give you hell when she's a teenager," megan teased."i know.trust me, i know."as caroline smiled up at her, megan couldn't help sighing."you're a bad influence, missy.you make me want to have another baby.""is that a bad thing?"aidan asked."no, it's just..." "just what?""i asked pesh to give me a year of marriage before we start trying.i know he's ready right now, but i just want this time with him.you know, just the two of us.""that's understandable.""but holding her..." megan shook her head."you're just bad for business, miss caroline."aidan laughed."tell me about it.whenever i hold her or noah, i think how much i'm going to miss it when they're not babies anymore.it nags at me enough that i think i'll be okay if we have more.""no vasectomy on the horizon?"he grinned."no yet.still not ruling it out though.and as far as you and more babies, you'll know when the time is right.and if anyone is patient and understanding, it's pesh.""that's true," megan murmured.mason appeared in the doorway then."'mon, mommy.want ice cweam!"megan laughed."okay, let me give your little bad influence back to you," she said, handing caroline to aidan.she then took mason's hand and started out of the bedroom."daddy says i have ice cweam first.""did he?"megan said, as she planned to strangle pesh."uh huh.'cause it's my'doption day."when she met pesh's eye, she raised her brows.immediately, his face flushed."spoiling him rotten already, aren't you?"she questioned in a low voice."i couldn't help it.it's a special day.""mmm, hmm, and when this special day turns into an all nighter because he's hyped on sugar, you're going to deal with him."pesh grinned."i will.i promise."megan leaned up to kiss him."you're too sweet for your own good.you're always going to have me playing bad cop when it comes to discipline.""but you love me anyway, right?"he murmured against her lips."so much i was almost ready to reconsider our plan about when we're starting a family."his eyes bulged at her response.it took him a few moments to speak."that means a lot that you would do that, but deep down i know how you really feel.so, i'm going to be good and patiently wait ten more months before confiscating your birth control.""it's a deal," she replied, before kissing him again.epilogue as soon as he finished with his last patient, pesh practically sprinted from the exam room.he hustled into the doctors' lounge, trying hard to keep his head down and not call any attention to himself.he wanted to be able to get out the door without anyone calling him back for a consult or to pull a longer shift.once he had retrieved his things, he started for the parking lot."dr.nadeen!"kristi called.inwardly, he groaned."yes?"he questioned, as he turned around."you weren't leaving, were you?"she asked.he exhaled a defeated breath."i was planning on it.does someone need me to cover for them?"kristi winked at him."thought you were screwed there for a minute, didn't you?"a relieved laugh escaped his lips."i did."she smiled."i have something for megan.""honestly kristi, you didn't need to do anything else for us."waving her hand dismissively, she handed a pink gift bag to him."i wanted to do this."after peeking inside, pesh smiled before he leaned down to hug kristi."thank you.i'm sure she'll love it.""you tell her we miss her around here.""i will."she patted his back."now go on home to your girls."he nodded and then hurried out the door.today had been his first day back after taking both paternity leave and some of his many amassed sick days.as he slid into the seat of his jaguar, he felt a rush of embarrassment at how he had actually gotten teary on the way to work that morning after leaving megan.it had been the longest shift of his entire life.he thought he would never be through so he could get home to her.even now, the usual ten-minute drive home seemed to take an eternity.he anxiously drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.he'd tried not to pester megan with too many calls and texts, but after the tenth, "how are you guys?"text, she'd told him to lighten up and get his head in the game at work.that's why he didn't even bother telling her he was on his way home.as he pulled into the driveway, he noticed emma's suv.he was glad to know that megan hadn't been alone without him.when he pushed through the garage door into the kitchen, emma was at the stove."hello," he called pleasantly.whirling around, she gave him a beaming smile."hello to you, too.""how are my girls?""good.they've slept most of the day."pesh nodded.noticing how quiet the house was, he asked, "where's mason?""patrick came by and got him, along with noah and caroline, a little while ago."she cocked her head at pesh and grinned."although he swore to me that he wouldn't ruin their dinner, i have a feeling they're having ice cream right now."pesh smiled at the mention of his son.although he wasn't mason's biological father, the love he felt for him was just as strong as if he had been a part of his conception.from the moment he'd been able to adopt him, he had felt an even stronger bond than before, especially whenever he saw "mason nadeen" written on his pre-school paperwork.more than anything, he relished being a father.he had been forced to wait so long, while desiring it so hard, that it made it all the more sweeter.because mason adored baseball, pesh had bought season tickets to the braves, rather than the opera.even though pesh had never been athletically inclined, he signed up to help coach mason's little league team as well.every time he heard mason say "daddy," it warmed his heart the same as it did to hear megan say "i love you."pesh eyed the dishes on the stove."it's awfully kind of you to come stay with megan on my first day back.but we certainly didn't expect for you to cook.""it's my pleasure.besides, it kills two birds with one stone-i can feed my family and yours.aidan's coming by after work.""good.i'll be glad to see him."as his gaze swept toward the living room, emma laughed."go on.you don't have to stay here with me.i know you want to see your girls."he smiled."thank you.i have missed them terribly today."after giving emma a quick kiss on the cheek, he made his way into the living room.at the sight of megan sleeping on the couch next to a frilly pink pack n play, his chest swelled with so much love and pride he felt like it might explode.peeking over the side of the pack n play, he eyed his dark-haired daughters.after waiting so long to become a father, he had been doubly blessed when they found out they were having twins.while aidan liked to claim that his fear of the twin gene in his family had bypassed him, and instead, it had found its way to megan, that wasn't entirely true.his girls were identical twins, which had nothing to do with old wives' tales.the two of them looked so much alike that megan put different colored socks on them to tell them apart.although it had freaked megan out a little at the prospect of two babies to care for along with mason, pesh was thrilled.every aspect of the pregnancy and birth had been special to him.thankfully, megan had been blessed with great health, although she had been advised to take early maternity leave to stay off her feet.after her clinicals, she had accepted a job in the er at wellstar, where they sometimes were on similar shifts.the girls arrived only a few weeks short of their due date and were both healthy five pounders.six weeks later, they were thriving and were the greatest joy in his life.sucking relentlessly on her pacifier, maya's wide eyes took in her surroundings.she stretched and flailed her arms.if she wasn't careful, she was going to hit her sister.since sara remained sleeping soundly, pesh bent over and picked maya up.he kissed her cheek before drawing her close to his chest.as he stared into her tiny face, he couldn't help the surge of love that overtook him.for all the years of struggle and heartache he had endured, it was moments like these that made him feel as though he was finally complete.his heart was full, and he was so thankful.once they learned they were having girls, he and megan had decided to give them both indian and irish names to represent their combined heritages.maya, which meant princess and honorable in indian, was coupled with katherine, to honor emma, whose middle name was katherine.without emma, he and megan never would have met.sara, which meant'soul', was given her mother's real name, margaret, as her middle name.at the sound of megan's gentle snores, he smiled."did you wear your mommy out today?"he asked maya.she opened her tiny mouth like she wished she could respond to him."let's wake her up."after he swept a strand of megan's long blonde hair out of her face, pesh leaned down to kiss her cheek.she stirred as her eyes fluttered opened."hey," she said with a lazy smile."hello, my love," he replied."how was your first day back?"she asked, as she stretched her arms over her head.he grimaced."absolutely miserable without you and the girls."megan smiled."we missed you, too."she jerked her chin up at maya."she cried for thirty minutes straight after you left.i think we have a serious daddy's girl on our hands.""really?"he asked, gazing down at maya.he couldn't help the warm glow that spread through his chest at megan's words.at just six weeks old, his girls were already showing distinct and different personalities.maya was inquisitive and fought sleep to be awake to see what all was going on.he'd ended up holding her more than sara simply because maya often exhausted megan by not going to sleep.sara, on the other hand, was already very sweet tempered and a natural snuggler.she probably represented his more laid-back, quiet personality where maya was likely to be a little firecracker, just like her mom.maya stared up at him, her dark eyes peering intently at him."did you miss me, my little princess?"a fleeting smile appeared on her face."oh my god, she smiled at you!"megan cried."but babies don't respond with smiling until later.it must be gas or something," he argued.megan nudged his leg with her knee."she most definitely smiled at you, pesh."she rose off the couch to rub maya's cheek."you smiled at your daddy, didn't you?"without taking her eyes off of pesh, maya flashed another smile and waved her fist.the sight caused tears to sting his eyes.he blinked fast, trying to clear them.he didn't like feeling emotionally weak in front of megan.but he knew he was busted the moment megan murmured, "oh baby."she slid her arm around his waist, leaning up on her tiptoes to burrow her face in his neck."do you know how much my love for you grows because you just got teary over your daughter?"he glanced down at her in surprise."really?""mmm, hmm."she gave him a brief kiss."after davis, all i ever wanted was for my children to have a father who loved and adored them."she smiled."you make that dream come true every day."he brought his lips to hers.his mouth worked frantically to illustrate all that he was feeling inside-the intense love that he felt would burst from him."i love you," he murmured against her lips."i love you, too."just as he started to kiss her again, a loud commotion in the kitchen drew them apart.megan rubbed his cheek tenderly before bestowing a kiss on maya's head.she then jerked her chin towards the kitchen, and he followed her.patrick had just burst through the backdoor with all the kids in tow."we're back!"mason called, as he bobbed around the kitchen.three-year-old noah and his two-year-old sister, caroline, made a beeline for their mother.they began chattering non-stop to emma while their bodies shook with unspent energy.pesh watched with amusement as emma's hand came to her hip and she pointed her stirring spoon at patrick."you gave them ice cream, didn't you?"patrick shrugged."i'm a grandfather.spoiling them is what i'm supposed to do."emma rolled her eyes."yeah, and then you bring them home to detox on my watch.""mommy, i hungwy!"caroline protested, stomping her foot.with her auburn hair swept back in pigtails and her emerald eyes narrowing in determination, she looked just like her mother.well, her expression was pure aidan."caroline fitzgerald, you get one ice cream cone in you, and you start acting like you have no manners.we do not stomp our feet to get what we want."she appeared thoughtful for a moment before saying, "pwease mommy, i vewy hungwy."emma grinned."go wash up and then have a seat at the table in the dining room.""come on guys," mason said.at almost four-and-a-half, he was always the caretaker of his younger cousins.noah and caroline followed him into the half bathroom off the kitchen.cradling maya in his arms, pesh joined emma at the stove."something sure smells good.""thank you.it's megan's favorite chicken casserole.then there's broccoli and cheese casserole, green beans, and some cornbread, extra crispy on the edges just like megan loves it."the corners of her mouth turned down in a frown."i'm sorry it's not indian food."he grinned."i would have been very surprised if it had been considering how much you didn't appreciate it many years ago."patrick nodded in agreement."that's quite a spread you've fixed for us."emma smiled."i was happy to do it.""are you feeling all right?"pesh asked, motioning to her expanding belly.emma patted her bump lovingly before responding."i think i've felt the best this pregnancy out of all the others.you would think with a three and two-year-old, i would be exhausted all the time, but it's amazing how good i've felt."patrick gave a beaming smile."i can't tell you how thrilled i am to be having yet another grandson to carry on the family name."with a wink, he added, "not to mention the fact he's been given fine irish names."aidan and emma had found out the sex of their third, and final child, the week before.they had decided on the name connor liam, which was a double representation of irish names.while emma's best friend, connor, was thrilled at the namesake, he also wanted them to call the baby connor as well.in the end, it would be liam fitzgerald joining the rest of the crew in four and a half months."and is aidan still feeling okay?"pesh asked.emma opened her mouth to answer him, but aidan chose that moment to walk in the door."me and my soon to be non-swimmers are just fine," he replied, with a grin.a week before he had gone under the laser for a vasectomy.while caroline had been a surprise, liam had not.with emma nearing thirty-four, they thought it best to finish out their family while they were still young.and while emma was pregnant and there were no worries about conception, aidan thought it was the best time to get his vasectomy and let it take effect."daddy!"caroline squealed, as she came bounding around the corner.aidan's grin grew wider as he took his daughter in his arms."hi sweet pea."she kissed both of his cheeks before she started wiggling, wanting down.noah ran to him next, and he got to hold his son a little longer as noah told him all about his day helping out with the babies.a cry from the living room snapped pesh's attention away from aidan and emma.megan was bending over the pack n play, picking up sara."aw, what's wrong, sweetheart?"she cooed, as she took sara into her arms.as megan rocked her back and forth, sara continued wailing, which caused maya's face to crumple up as well."you must be hungry.""i'll get their bottles," pesh called, over the twin's loud cries."thank you."as emma worked to gather the kids, along with patrick and aidan, around the dining room table, pesh got busy heating up the formula.once he had the two bottles fixed, he grabbed them and then went to the dining room.megan was already seated with mason trying to entertain sara to stop crying her crying.he passed a bottle to megan before sitting down himself.he'd barely gotten the bottle in her mouth before maya started sucking greedily at the formula.as aidan reached to start spooning some chicken casserole onto his plate, patrick shot him a disapproving look.with a sigh, aidan dropped the serving spoon."you gon na say grace even though it's not your house, pop?""why yes, i am.it's good for all these children to learn," he replied, motioning to noah and caroline who sat between their parents, and then over to mason."it should be up to pesh and megan whether it's said or not," aidan grumbled.pesh held up his free hand that wasn't holding maya."it's fine.truly, i don't mind."aidan mouthed "suck up" at him before grinning.pesh merely shook his head at aidan's antics."then let's return thanks," patrick said.with maya still taking long pulls at her bottle, pesh bowed his head.as patrick recited the blessing, pesh couldn't help feeling so very blessed himself.three years ago, the dining room would have been empty.most likely, he would have been grabbing something on the way home or finishing some leftover takeout.but now, he had a beautiful, loving wife by his side-one he fell a little more in love with each and every day.across from him, he had a son who was strong and healthy.in his arms and his wife's, he had two daughters who he couldn't wait to see what the future held for them.he also had the love and support of good friends and family.at the end of the day, true love in its many forms was all you could really hope for and cling to.chapter 1 that's it.i'm spanking her ass as soon as we get back to the house, right before i f**k her little ass into submission.i watched with the other couple hundred thousand spectators as she gyrated her ass and flaunted what belonged to me for all to see.yes, i know it's her job as the newest and hottest pop sensation on the scene today, but we talked about this shit.i have no problem with her performing, but there's such a thing as going too far.she'd come out on the stage dressed conservatively enough in the floor length dress with the split up the middle to her crotch.even that was a bit risque for my taste, but i couldn't expect her to change everything overnight.what i didn't expect, and what was now driving me insane, is the two piece bikini number she was now wearing after dropping the dress, or more to the point, after one of the male dancers had undressed her on stage.no one sitting near me could tell that i was seething with rage.i kept my face at ease and my slouch in the chair in the front row of the awards show was that of a man with nothing on his mind but enjoying the show.by now everyone knew we were an item, the thirty-five year old business mogul, and the twenty -three year old pop sensation.we'd been able to keep our affair hidden for all of two months and that only because of my high security.but now the cat was out of the bag and everyone was in our f**king business.i wasn't too worried about it, i just don't like my personal life splashed across the headlines, but i guess it came with the territory.i'd seen her for the first time three months ago.it was at a lingerie show of all things.not my usual milieu, but my sister had dragged me along since her husband was away on business, and she didn't want to go it alone.i'd sat there prepared to be bored out of my mind for the next two hours or so.i've seen and had my fair share of models over the years, and they no longer appealed.so imagine my surprise when she came on stage.i had no idea who she was, but from the crowd's reaction she was someone of note; before she even opened her mouth to sing the place had gone insane.it was her voice that caught my attention first, sultry and hot, with an old world flavor to it.when i finally looked up at the stage, my breath had got caught in my lungs.she was f**king magnificent.i wondered how many of the men in the audience were focused on her instead of the scantily clad models as they made their way down the runway.i know i spent the next three minutes or however long the song was, totally captivated by her.i pulled my phone and cancelled my dinner date and essentially ended the six-month relationship i'd been barely having with another woman.i'm a man of action, i've learned in the cutthroat world of high finance that there's no other way to be.when i see something that i want, i go after it.consequences be damned.they had her name highlighted behind her on the stage so i used my phone to google her.i needed to find out what moves i had to make to acquire her.if she were married, i'd step back.that's not my style.anything else, she was fair game.shiane; she was twenty-three years old and had been heating up the charts for the last two with hit after hit since her debut.she'd only been linked with one guy in the past two years.some on again, off again deal with a kid who was not much older than she.they were having an off period; perfect.if i had anything to say about that, it would be a permanent thing, or until i'd had my fill at least.i'm not one for long relationships.i stay as long as they run their course and leave when they've grown stale.i have yet to find a woman who could hold my interest for more than a few months at a time.and i always let them know up front what the deal is.though it seemed women were always saying they were fine with it until the end came.like cynthia, that night when i'd called to tell her it was over.it wasn't the most conventional way to do things.usually, i sent over one of tiffany's little blue boxes to ease the blow, but there was no time, so i'd have to do it the next day.she started to get upset on the phone and i had to remind her of the words i'd spoken on our first date.she wasn't too happy, but it will have to suffice.as much of a bastard as i am, the thought of pursuing one woman while embroiled with another, just didn't suit me.after the phone call, i'd sat there and watched the anorexic looking clothe-horses as they pranced up and down the stage.there was still a buzz about the hot little starlet who'd just left the stage, and i smiled quietly to myself when i heard some ass behind me tell his friends that he was going to make his move.the program said she had one more performance near the end of the show, so i sat patiently and waited.when she came out the second time, i actually sat up in my seat.my back wasn't the only thing that went ramrod straight.though i didn't appreciate the comments from the other men around me that night, i had to admit that she was f**king hot, as one of them had claimed.she was dressed pretty much like one of the models; only she'd covered the panty and bra set with a see-through silk robe that didn't leave much to the imagination.she outshone everyone there and it helped that she actually had a body.she was all smooth curves, and her legs, i could already imagine being held between them as i f**ked her.whether by providence, or fate, whatever you wan na call it, our eyes met, and in that split second i saw all i needed to know.i don't think anyone else caught the faltering misstep in her routine, or heard the catch in her voice, but so in tuned was i, that i didn't miss a thing.chapter 2 i waited until her number was over and the last call for the models came through the pa. then i made my excuses to my sister, who thankfully, was involved in a conversation with the woman on her other side so wasn't paying too much attention, and therefore wasn't in my business."i'll be right back sis, there's something i need to take care of.i made my way backstage the way i do most things; like i owned the place.bypassing scantily clad women and harassed assistants, i avoided their hungry gazes as i kept my gaze peeled for that waterfall of cascading curls.she was off to the side surrounded by a bevy of people who were trying to hustle her through a door to the back.i made my way towards them and grabbed her elbow.she looked back and up and in her eyes i saw acceptance.she turned to the pushy woman next to her and whispered something before following me.she didn't really have a choice as i had no intentions on releasing my hold on her.as soon as i found an empty room, which turned out to be some sort of storage space, i did something i don't recall having ever done before, but had been dying to for that last hour or so.crowding her back against the door to keep it closed, i held her eyes as i lowered my head to hers.licking across her lips, i found the taste of strawberries suddenly intoxicating.i pushed one leg between hers and pulled her body in close as i fed her my tongue."fuck you're sweet."i nibbled from her lips to her ear."you're coming home with me.""i can't i..." i buried my hands in her hair, pulling her head back."whatever it is that you're about to say won't make a difference.feel this."i pressed her hand against her own racing heart."now feel this."lifting her i pushed my c**k into the junction of her thighs where i could feel her hot pu**y through the silk of her clothing."do you feel that?that means that no one and nothing is going to stand in the way of me having you.we don't have to f**k tonight, but you're sleeping in my bed."she seemed overwhelmed by my approach and rested her head against my chest.i took the opportunity to call my sister and make my excuses."sis, i'm sending a car for you, something came up and i have to leave."we said our goodbyes and i called my driver who was having an evening off since i'd driven my sister here tonight.he had no problem with the last minute call since he knew he'd be handsomely compensated for the inconvenience."let's get out of here."i don't know how we escaped the glare of flashing cameras that night, but somehow we did.i'd covered her scantily clad body with my suit jacket and held her under my arm as we made our way to the valet parking where they'd brought my bugatti around in less then five minutes.i held her hand all the way to my home in the car.there were no words spoken between us in the ten minutes or so it had taken for us to get there.i could feel the racing of her pulse and see the apprehension in her eyes.when i helped her out of the car in the underground garage, i pressed her up against the door and swallowed her tongue again.she was young and fresh and so f**king sweet she made me ache.i loved the way she rubbed herself against my cock, almost as if she couldn't help herself."i'm going to enjoy having you under me shiane."i took her hand and led her into the building, bypassing the bank of elevators to my own personal lift in the corner.she kept her head down, maybe because she didn't want to be recognized by the doorman and security, or maybe because she was shy, i was inclined to believe it was the latter.once we got to my penthouse, she seemed shy and unsure of herself.i'm not one to buy into preconceived notions.there's been plenty written about me in the tabloids over the years that bears no resemblance to the truth, and though i hadn't come across anything inflammatory about her in my little impromptu search, i was sure she dealt with her fair share of bullshit.i also had to take into consideration her age.she was young yet, for all that she was world travelled and famous, sometimes those things could hide a multitude of things.like the fact that her shyness and hesitance was not contrived.my first order of business was to put her at ease.walking over to where she stood in front of the door as if ready to escape at a moment's notice, i took my jacket from around her shoulders.i kept my eyes on her bent head until i threw the jacket in the general direction of the chair in the corner.then lifting her chin with the tip of my finger, i looked into her eyes."you have nothing to fear here; it's like i said, we don't have to f**k each other tonight.i can maybe hold off until tomorrow, but i want you in my bed, in my arms.what i saw tonight, i would be a fool to waste any time.""um, what's your name?"i threw my head back and laughed uproariously.i'm such a beast.i hadn't even introduced myself.it's a wonder she hadn't run away screaming bloody murder."i'm trace mckenzie."her eyes widened a bit at my name and led me to my next question."you know my name?""everybody knows who you are, don't they?""i don't know about everyone, but maybe a good few do.can i get you something to drink?what do you usually do after a performance, which was magnificent by the way.""i usually have warmed lemon and honey with a glass of water.it helps keep my throat soothed, but i don't expect you to have that stuff here, so it's okay."she bit her lip and looked down at her feet even more shy now.very endearing.i walked over to the in house phone and called down to have them go pick me up what she needed from the all-night market a few blocks over."that's taken care of.it should be here in a few.why don't we go out onto the patio and relax until they get here?"i took her elbow and led her outside where the stars were putting on a show in the night sky.i was amazed at my control, everything in me wanted in her now.but somehow, i knew this, whatever it was between us wouldn't be rushed.i quirked my brow at my thoughts.i'm not one for patience and i'd be the first to admit it.she moved to sit in the chair next to mine, but i had other ideas.pulling her down into my lap, i didn't give her time to protest before my lips were covering hers again.i couldn't seem to get enough of her taste.she was wearing the same silk robe and underwear she'd worn on stage and her body's heat seared me.by the time the bell chimed announcing the arrival of her delivery, my hands were buried in her beautiful hair and my c**k was digging into her hip.i sat her in the seat a little dazed and went to answer the door.in the kitchen i prepared the concoction for her and had a weird sense that i was going to be doing that a lot in the future.that's something else i never pay too much attention to, the future.i usually let the chips fall where they may."here love, i hope it's the way you like it."she took the tumbler from me and sipped."umm, perfect thanks trace."i hunkered down in front of her and she stopped with the glass halfway to her lips.i held her eyes as i tried to form the words in my head."do you have any upcoming engagements planned?""i have three weeks until my next show, i don't go on tour for another couple of months and i just wrapped up in the studio a few days ago.""then the next three weeks are mine.let's go to bed tomorrow is going to be a long day."i took the empty glass from her and led her inside.she was back to being nervous which was totally understandable."the bedroom's through there with an en suite bath if you'd like.i'll find you something to sleep in."she walked on in the direction i'd pointed out while i turned for the kitchen.when i made it back to the bedroom she was in the shower.it took everything i had in me not to go after her.the night sure was turning into one for the books.i've never brought a woman home for the sole purpose of just having here there.she came out fifteen minutes later and i fought the kick in my heart.she looked like a teenager with her hair brushed out around her shoulders and her face bare of makeup.i walked over and unwrapped the towel she had clutched in her fist."fuck me, it's gon na be a long f**king night."she was perfection.her tits, which for some reason had been hidden in the robe were magnificent, i would say a dd or close, with pale pink ni**les that almost blended into the rest of her flesh.her waist was tiny, i could easily span it with my hands and her hips had a nice flare to them.all woman and now all mine.it was topped off with a homegrown beauty that you never see these days.pink flesh with a hint of a tan on her cheeks, and the cutest sprinkling of freckles across her perfectly upturned nose."i see you're a real blonde."her whole body lit up with her blush at my mention of the strip of hair over her pu**y mound.i kissed the top of her head as i passed her the tee shirt i'd chosen for her to sleep in.another first, i usually avoided too much familiarity with the women i dealt with.having her sleep in my favorite old college shirt was very telling in deed, but we'll see how this plays out."i'll be right out sweetie, you can watch tv until i'm done or if you're tired go to sleep."i left her standing there and went to my own shower before i went back on my word and threw her to the ground and f**ked her the way i imagined.i barely avoided rubbing one out in the shower; just let the water beat down on me as cold as i could stand it, cooling me down a little.when my felt the slight ping in my heart i held my hands out to wall and hung my head as the water cascaded down on me.i knew what was happening to me, knew it down to my bones, should i fight it or let it take its natural course?i'd never felt threatened before, in all my years of playing the filed, there was never a time when my bachelorhood was in danger.it was too early yet, or at least that was the crutch i held onto as i turned the water off and stepped out of the marble shower stall.wrapping a towel around my hips and grabbing another i walked into the bedroom to find her asleep.my new baby was tired.i stood over her, taking in the softness of her beauty in sleep.i wonder how many people had ever seen this side of her.i had a brief stab of jealousy at the thought of the boy she'd been linked with.i ran my fingers gently through her hair, going softly so i didn't awaken her.i shook my head at myself after i leaned over and kissed her hair."so f**king beautiful."i whispered the words in her ear before heading to the closet for some boxer shorts.no sleeping in the buff tonight, i'd changed the game plan somewhere between seeing her on that stage and handing her that tee shirt.i was treading unchartered waters here, so we'll play it by ear, but there's always been one constant with me throughout my lifetime.i always play to win.i couldn't help drawing her into my arms when i finally crawled into bed.she just cuddled into my chest and settled, just like this kitten i once had as a child.what the f**k?i haven't thought of my f**ked up childhood or anything to do with it in a long time.i looked down at the head on my chest and felt fear for the first time in my life, or at least for the first time in forever.what was i to do with this new thing that was growing inside of me?i have no notion of how to deal with love and all its trappings.i'm man enough to own my feelings, but logical enough, grounded enough not to believe in love at first sight.but this whatever it was that had hit me from out of left field, was a close second.i fell asleep with the thought of what tomorrow might bring for us.first time in thirteen years, that i didn't close my eyes with a spreadsheet running through my head.chapter 3 in the morning my eyes popped open to land on hers as she looked up at me from her place on my chest."morning beautiful girl."i drew her in for a cuddle and to sniff the morning scent of her skin.she felt right in my arms, in my bed.when i pulled back she was looking at me askance."this is so weird, i hope you don't think i'm in the habit of going home with strange men..." "whatever you did or did not do before we met last night is in the past.besides, i don't remember giving you much of a choice.""i'm gon na kiss you now sweet shiane, don't worry about my hard cock, it can't seem to help doing that around you."i turned her onto her back and covered her body with mine.starting at her ear i kissed my way down her jawline to the corner of her mouth before taking soft nibbles of her lips.i didn't force my way in this time, but made her want my tongue so much that she was the one who came in search of it.she was the one who took my face in her hands and forced my lips open with her tongue.i told myself to go easy even as i pressed my aching c**k into her heat.her shirt had ridden up so that all that stood between us were a few scraps of silk.my control lasted for all of ten seconds before i was eating at her lips, my hands roaming all over her body."fuck, f**k, f**k... shiane."i buried my face in her neck and prayed for the strength to leave it there, not to push her panties aside and slip into her heat that i knew was going to own my ass.when she nuzzled my head and squeezed me between her legs, i knew the jig was up."baby we got ta get up; i'm trying to keep my word here but you're not making it easy."i sucked the skin of her neck between my teeth and rocked my c**k back and forth into her, my c**k ring hitting her clit with each stroke and driving me insane.she hissed and shook beneath me."fuck baby don't do that."i gritted my teeth and rolled away with my arm thrown over my eyes."fuck!get off the bed baby... please."she hesitated for a minute before i felt her leave the bed.this was not f**king happening to me.how the f**k was this happening to me?when i felt my breathing calm enough and my dick was down to a slow throb instead of a raging pulse, i lifted my hand and looked at her.she looked so f**king young and innocent standing there, unsure of the crazy man who'd dragged her off to his lair in the middle of the night and was now acting like an ass."i'm sorry baby if you'd stayed here one second more i would've f**ked you.since i kinda gave my word i don't want to go back on it.that's no way to start thins off.it's saturday morning, you said you don't really have anything pressing on the calendar so i'll tell you what we're gon na do.""i'm pretty sure if we went anywhere in this city you'd be recognized in five minutes flat am i right?""yeah pretty much.""and you didn't bring any clothes with you obviously, so going out to breakfast was pretty much out anyway, for now at least.so... i'm gon na go downstairs and make us some breakfast sounds good?""yeah, okay."i studied her as she stood there with her hair all mussed from my fingers, my mark forming on her neck and the shirt hanging off her shoulder.it was the sexiest f**king thing i'd ever seen."i changed my mind come'ere."she made a running leap for the bed and landed on top of me, causing my eyes to open in surprise.the smile that broke out across my face was another shared first as i pulled her head down and clasping her there, took her lips in another wild kiss.she kissed like an innocent and i found it thrilling to teach her my showing her how to chase my tongue with hers.my c**k was leaking profusely at this point as i enjoyed running my tongue around the inside of her mouth, over her teeth, and lips before diving back in.it was a long time since i'd dry humped anyone, but f**k if that isn't what i found myself doing.with one hand clasped behind her head and the other holding her ass in place, i moved her body over mine, while my c**k started leaking even more into my shorts.i wanted to turn her over onto her back and just take her, but i didn't.instead i pressed her cunt harder into my aching c**k and ground our pelvises together.she moaned into my mouth and quivered as i felt the first burst of cum leave my spewing cock.we laid still until our breathing went back to normal."i think a shower is in order don't you?"i sat up with her still in my lap and rolled out of bed, headed for the shower.shiane i can't believe i'm doing this.nothing like this has ever happened to me before, but when i'd looked into his eyes last night while on stage, there was something there that called to me, what that was i still wasn't sure, but somehow i knew i would be a fool to let it pass.i would've gone on as usual if he hadn't approached me, i'm not bold enough to have sought him out.but now that i was here i wasn't sure of my moves.i've only ever been with one guy, someone i met when i first started my music career.i'd saved myself all through high school, holding out for that special someone.and then after i'd been discovered, i'd been too busy in the studio and with other engagements to think about a relationship.i've never been into the casual scene, so when i met donnie, i'd thought i'd found my soul mate.someone i could spend my life with.that was before i'd overheard him making plans to hook up with someone else.that day was the lowest point of my life.when i'd confronted him after coming out of the bathroom unexpectedly and overheard him, he'd grown angry.angry enough to hit me for questioning him; then he'd filled me in on the truth.he'd only been with me because it was good for his career.he thought that being linked to the hottest new number on the music scene would open doors for him, which it did.he called me a stupid little farm girl with rose-colored glasses.as he put it, everyone was doing it; it was known part of the business.people f**ked one another to get ahead.when i'd stupidly told him i thought we would get married like we'd talked about he'd laughed in my face.it was then that my love had started to die.it didn't die completely until news of our split got out and i learned that this wasn't the first time he'd cheated, and that everyone thought i knew.apparently they thought i was doing the same.i was never so humiliated in my life, all our friends, if you can call them that; had known.i'd slipped out of the spotlight for a while until my management told me i had to appear with the snake for publicity sake because of prior agreements and the album we'd collaborated on together.so for a few months the world thought we were an item again.it was hard, especially when he cornered me one day after rehearsal and said we could just pick up where we left off, i was an okay f**k after all.i didn't even know this person.all i could do was walk away in disgust.since then he'd called me a few times, he knew i wasn't seeing anyone and since he'd been my first somehow this little farm girl should just overlook his infidelity and turn a blind eye, because according to him i was never going to find better, because everybody in the business cheats.now here i am, not even a month later doing something i never thought in a million years i would ever do.when i opened my eyes this morning and saw him there, his face relaxed in sleep, so perfectly handsome.the first thing that caught my attention was the tattoos on his chest and arms.the business suit sure hadn't prepared me for that, or for what i was sure was a piercing in his cock.of course i knew who he was, everyone did, the self-made billionaire who'd come from nothing.his story was told far and wide in all circles.a male cinderella story if you will.from what i remember his parents had been poor, from some place in the midwest.he'd boxed in high school and gained a scholarship to an ivy league university where he'd continued his boxing career but had focused more on his studies.then he'd invented some game software and used the money from that to start his own securities firm.they called him the wonder kid of wall street.though kid wasn't exactly accurate.he put me down in the bathroom long enough to start the shower before he turned back to me and lifted the worn tee shirt over my head.i was embarrassed as he pulled my panties down my thighs and when i stepped out of them and he picked them up and brought them up to his face, i thought my body would go up in flames.his eyes held mine as he lowered them and then he was pulling me back into that hard chest of his again and our mouths mated.he dropped his shorts while our tongues were playing tag and turned me towards the huge marble stall.no words were spoken as he soaped up his hands and washed by body.his hands glided over me, slowly, taking his time as he touched my body, as though he were paying homage."i love your body baby, so f**king much."he seemed hypnotized with by my chest, which until the look in his eyes, had always been a source of embarrassment for me.they were just too... everything.but that way he touched them made me feel beautiful."get up here."he picked me up so that my legs went around his waist and his mouth covered mine once more as my now slippery body slid all over his chest.i feel the hardness of his c**k pressing into my ass up to the small of my back.i had a moment's pause at the length of him.there was no way that thing would ever fit inside me."we have to stop baby."he took a few more nibbles of my lips before letting me slip down his body.we finished our shower after he'd passed me the soap to return the favor.my heart all but flew out of my chest as i ran my hands over his beautiful chest.my face heated up as i leaned over and kissed his chest and i felt a sense of power when his body shook.he turned off the water and led me out of the shower.grabbing a towel he dried me before going to a door in the bathroom that led to a closet of sorts.he came back with a long silk robe that obviously belonged to him, and one for himself.downstairs in the kitchen he kissed me once more before seating me on a stool at the island and turning to the fridge."an omelet okay princess?""yes, sounds great."princess, how did he know that i've always wanted someone to call me that?he couldn't have, so that was just another sign that there was something going on here that went beyond the obvious.he plated the omelets and sat down across from me after pouring us both cups of coffee from his state of the art coffee maker.i studied the kitchen for something to so instead of staring at his chest that was exposed by the gap in his robe.i could stare at it all, or his beautiful face with those cerulean blue eyes that seemed to darken whenever he looked at me."today is saturday, monday morning we're going to my private doctor to have tests done.not that i think you're unsafe, this is for both of us.when i take you there will be nothing between us and i want you to be comfortable with the fact that i'm clean as well.""i see from the gossip rags that you've only had one serious relationship since you came onto the music scene, tell me about that."i laid my fork down and folded my arms around my middle."what do you want to know?""everything."it almost sounded like a growl.i kept my head down; surely this was a bit personal for two people who'd only just met; more personal than cumming all over him and he you you ninny?i blushed at the memory and felt my body shudder.i almost jumped out of my skin when his finger lifted my chin."now's not the time to think about what i can and will do to you sweetie, we need to clear some things up first; eat your breakfast."i told him about meeting donnie, about my childhood in the southwest and the life i'd left behind to follow my dream of becoming a singer, the years of hard work before the payoff.the supportive family who was still very much a part of my life and whom i stayed in contact with by weekly phone calls and skype chats.of course i left out the most embarrassing details of my messy break-up with donnie.no one outside our circle knew the real reason behind the break, but i knew it was only a matter of time before that was no longer a secret.but somehow i couldn't find it in me to tell this virile man who looked at me like i was the hottest sex object on the planet, that i had been such an abject failure; or that i had been such a gullible, green fool."did you love him?"i looked up at him then, there was something in his voice, something i couldn't quite place but it sounded menacing somehow.i swallowed hard before i answered him."i thought i did, but now i'm not sure what i was feeling.maybe i was caught up in the excitement of my new life and he was the first interesting guy to ever pay me any attention, or the first one that i noticed anyway.""do you two still stay in touch?""no, only if we're working on one of our songs or something that calls for us to work together in a professional capacity.""and how often does that happen?""we just did an album together.it was finished just before we broke up.we might have to perform the songs together at awards shows and things like that in the future, i'm not sure of anything right now though.""that's something we'll have to deal with, something you should know before we go any farther.i'm a very territorial about my possessions.i don't share shiane, not ever.""i find myself in new territory here though, because i've never cared about a woman's past before, never cared how many partners she had before me.with you i find that i hate this boy for having had you.it's silly i know, since you know of me, then you know that i've not been a monk myself.i don't know why i should feel this way, it just is."i didn't say anything to that, what was there to say?like he said i'd read of his exploits along with the rest of america.he was a known lady's man.not necessarily a skirt chaser, it seems they were usually the ones doing the chasing.none of his encounters if i remember correctly had ever lasted more than a few months at the most.is that what he was after now?because if it was, as much as i felt that strong pull for him, i don't think i was ready for a fling.something of my inner thoughts must've shown on my face because he brought my attention back to him with his next words."stop worrying, like i told you, whatever was in the past is just that, the past."could i ask him outright what his intentions were, or would he find the question gauche and immature?that as something else donnie had accused me of.he'd said that my ideals were old and outdated.apparently it was against the new social norm to actually want to have a meaningful relationship that lasted longer than the time it took to scratch an itch."you said there were some things that we needed to clear up before we went any farther, well i think you should know i'm not into casual flings, i..." "i think i got that princess."he didn't say anything else for the longest while, just studied me over his coffee mug."i don't know where this is going, not exactly, but i do know there isn't going to be anything casual about it.chapter 4 trace i didn't take her home until later that evening.i'd turned her phone off at about noon after it had rung for the tenth time in half an hour.i had her send off a quick text to her assistant so that they knew she was alive and that was it.she seemed a bit panicked at first and i knew the feeling, since i'd once been synced with my phone and any form of communication, until i'd learned to compartmentalize.we spent the time getting to know each other, when i wasn't kissing her.i didn't risk getting too hot and heavy with her again, because i didn't trust myself to stop.when i take her i want to feel her pu**y around my cock.i have never in my life f**ked a woman without some kind of protection and definitely not without a condom.i didn't look too deeply at my reasons for wanting to do it with her.all i know is that the memory of her on that stage the night before, the jolt that had gone through me when our eyes connected, was something that i wasn't willing to brush aside.i've spent my life following my gut and hunches that others had scoffed at, only to come out on top.this just might be the biggest f**king hunch i ever play in my life.if the beautiful girl that was sitting on my lap in my living room, dressed only in one of my robes, knew the thoughts that were going through my head i'm not sure she wouldn't have been looking for the nearest exit.everything about her called to something in me, something i hadn't known was there.by the time i took her home to her apartment on the other side of the park i was second guessing myself.outside her apartment i looked for a parking spot."you don't have to walk me up you know, i'm perfectly safe here.""no deal princess, i'm contemplating turning around and taking you back home, the only reason i'm not is because you don't have anything to wear and i'm sure you have stuff to take care of.but i'm coming up with you.i'm not ready for our first date to be over just yet.she blushed and smiled and reached over to kiss me but then seemed to think better of it.so i was the one who held her head and pulled her the rest of the way.if there were any cameras around i didn't care in that moment.though i understood her concerns, she'd explained about how precious her privacy had become since she'd found stardom, how the simplest thing like running out for a carton of milk had now become a monumental task.that was something else i was going to have to take care of.i wasn't sure from what she'd said, what kind of security detail she had on a daily basis.i mean look how easy it had been for me to get to her and literally take her out of their hands.on top of her own star status, being linked with me might put her even more in the spotlight, so i was gon na have to take care of that first thing.i helped her out of the car and through the doors.she was wearing a pair of my jeans rolled at the ankles and around the waist, but of course she'd made it look like a fashion statement.we made it up to her apartment with no interruptions and i was still holding her hand.i loved the look of her place, it was open space and airy with windows all around with a view of the park and a bit of the city skyline.it was nothing like mine, but it wasn't shabby either.i saw little touches of her here, in the bright colors and soft throw pillows that she seemed to have a fondness for.she was back to being shy again but at lease it seemed to stem more from what i thought of her place this time.we'd spent the day practically locked together in every way but one, so most of her reticence had melted away somewhat."i like it.grab some stuff you're coming back with me.""you... i thought you said you were brining me home to take care of stuff and you'll see me on monday?"i looked down at her as she turned that little innocent face up to me."i did say that baby, but i changed my mind.i'm not ready for us to be apart."i had the fleeting thought that i may never be ready for that again, but squashed it."do you need help packing?"i thought i saw a bit of a smile touch the corners of her lips before she shook her head no."can i at least check my messages first?""sure."she walked over to the machine and hit play as she dropped into a chair.i walked over to the bank of windows with my hands stuffed in my pockets.the first few messages were just business as usual, but then coming onto the end there was some guy, maybe her manager who seemed very irate that he couldn't get ahold of her."i thought you said you didn't have anything plan for the next little while?""i don't that's just carl's way, he likes to know where i am at all times.""hmm."it sounded like a bit more than that to me, but i let it got for now.i'm a grown man, so that means when she's with me this carl person could go f**k himself, because i didn't need anyone keeping tabs on me.there was nothing else worrying on there and she headed into her bedroom to pack after offering me a drink, which i turned down.i just wanted out of there and back home as soon as possible.somehow i felt easier with her in my bed, behind my walls.she came back out with an overnight bag and dressed in a pair of her own jeans and a pullover.i took the bag and with her hand in mine headed for the door.monday morning i had to go in early to the office, so i eased her out of my arms and went to the shower.she was still out by the time i was dressed and ready to go so i leaned over the bed and kissed her awake."hmmm."she sighed into my mouth as she awakened with my tongue in hers.i ended up sitting on the side of the bed and pulling her into my lap for a longer kiss.truth is i hated the thought of leaving her.the last two days had been like none i'd ever shared and we hadn't even left the house except to go to her place.we'd spent all day sunday lazing around in bed reading the paper, talking or making out.i'd already called my doctor and made the appointments adding pressure for him to rush the results which he assured me can be done."i'll see you in a couple hours princess, the car will come and get you around ten thirty, okay?"i kissed her nose when she nodded against my chest and got up to leave.i didn't look back at her there in my bed in my old ratty tee shirt, i was sure i wouldn't want to leave her if i did.when it was time to send the car for her i changed my plans and instead of meeting her there i went after her myself.she was putting on her shoes when i came through the door and when she saw me standing there, f**k me if her whole face didn't light up and she made a running leap and jumped into the arms i had opened for her."hey beautiful, you missed me?"she sniffed my neck and nodded before i pulled her head around for my lips to find hers."we'd better go, john promised me that if we did this early he could possibly get us the results by end of day today and i'm afraid if we don't i'm gon na f**king explode."i pulled her down just enough for her to feel the evidence of my need.i had no doubts that she was clean and i was sure that i was, but somehow i wanted this, wanted us to start things off on the right foot.i ignored the little voice in my head that told me there was an ulterior motive behind my actions.there was no way i was thinking along those lines, no way in hell.shiane i wondered if he was always this attentive, or if as with all things new, this would change once he got what he wanted.will he start taking advantage of me as time went on?he was like no other man i'd ever known, except for maybe one.i'd seen my dad treat my mom like a precious gem my whole life.it's where i'd got my dream of a prince charming.not from any storybook, but from the way i'd seen my dad look at mom when he thought no one else was looking.or the way she was always looking to him when things went south.they'd taught me to want that bond, to hold out for that and nothing less.trace seemed to have that in him, but i'd been burnt once and my heart was a little gun shy.it had only been a few weeks since it was shattered after all.but here i was with sweaty palms and weak knees over this guy that i barely knew.the weekend had been the best one i'd had in a long time.in fact i haven't felt that relaxed since the last time i'd taken a trip home.neither of us seemed ready for the intrusion of the world just yet.we wanted to enjoy getting to know each other without all the speculation and other nonsense that came with stardom.downstairs there were two men in suits who looked like they'd never smiled a day in their lives."this is your security, i'm sure you have some already for business purposes, but these two are from me.they'll shadow everywhere when i'm not with you.my eyes widened at that."is that really necessary?i'm not that big of a star yet i don't think."i tried laughing it off as he introduced me to the two and pulled me out the doors behind him."this has nothing to do with your status, it's for my peace of mind."i started to wonder if this was something he'd done for all the women in his past and why that should make me jealous.he squeezed my hand and looked down at me."no, you're the first.""how did you know what i was thinking?""i told you, the weekend was about getting to know each other, i picked up a few things."he smirked as he helped me into the back of the town car.i'd told him of my fear of needles so he held my hand and talked to me while the doctor and the nurse did their thing, before having his taken care of.it didn't take that long and soon we were back in the car."i'm taking you to the office for a quick tour and then it's lunch.we'll go somewhere that i'm sure we'd be left alone, i'm not quite ready to share us yet."i rested my head on his shoulder and squeezed his hand that was still holding onto mine.i think he must've planned this and warned everyone in the building not to give me the star treatment because i saw a lot of interested looks from his employees, but no one said anything more than a friendly hello.it was great.lunch was in a private room in one of the city's more upscale restaurants where there were more a list stars than i'd ever seen in one place at once except maybe an awards show.i was the one star-struck."is that...?""yes it is."i must've said that a hundred times before we were seated.i craned my neck to see into the other room and he laughed at me."you're so cute.they're looking at you and you're in awe of them.""i'm pretty sure they're all wondering who i am, it's you they're looking at."i wasn't sure i was too far off the mark, most of them were starlets and they might've given me the once over, but their attention was definitely on him.i couldn't blame them.what he did for a suit should be illegal.and to think that what was underneath was even more mouth wateringly spectacular.chapter 5 trace i sent her home in the car and went back to work, my mind on the results and how soon i can have them in my hands.i almost called john when the hours had drifted by and still no phone call.by the end of day when it was almost time to call it quits, the messenger showed up with the envelopes.i had no compunction about tearing into hers and reading the results.as soon as i got the all clear my body reacted."thank f**k!"i left my office almost at a run.my assistant called out to me as i was heading for the elevators."is it a matter of life or death susan?""uh no sir.""then it'll keep until tomorrow."i stepped in and pressed the down button.i would've called her and let her know i was on the way but even that was too much right now.if i heard that sultry voice of hers on the phone i might embarrass myself again.i was on a hair trigger, the slightest thing would set me off, and the next time i cum, i want to be inside her.she came running when i cleared the door."hey you're home i made din..." i threw the envelopes on the little side table near the entry and grabbed her up in my arms."later."my mouth came down on hers as i walked us blindly towards the bedroom.i didn't even stop kissing her long enough to take off the little summery top and shorts she wore."undress me."her hands shook a little as she went after my tie and then the buttons of my shirt while i dropped my jacket on the floor and kicked off my shoes.she seemed fascinated with the ink on my torso, and couldn't help running her tongue over it, so i took care of my belt and the zipper on my pants before she stopped me."no, i wan na do it."i released it and left her to it.she'd learned my body in the last tow days, as much as i would let her.i'd refused to let her take my c**k in her mouth so she'd spent what felt like hours measuring me in her hands and teasing the shit out of me while i sucked her ni**les and finger f**ked her.now she got to her knees and removed my socks.i watched her through half slitted eyes as she looked up at me with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, right before her tongue came out and licked the pr**cum from my cockhead.my body jerked and my hands fell to her hair, holding her in place as she licked and nibbled her way down my shaft, biting into my c**k ring, before taking half of me into her mouth."fuck!"i threw my head back as she massaged my c**k with her throat muscles and she had great control from all the voice exercises she'd done over the years.i was almost ready to pop when she took my balls in her hand and caressed them with the lightest touch."that's enough, i don't want to cum in your mouth, not this first time."picking her up, i headed for the bed and laid her back with her legs splayed open.i hadn't allowed myself the pleasure of studying her pu**y; i was waiting for this moment.kneeling on the floor i ran my nose over her wet heat before pulling back and opening her up with my fingers.she was pink and soft and wet.i teased her with the tip of my tongue, before licking deep into her pu**y.her back bowed off the bed and she looked down at me in wonder.i got the idea from her reaction that this was a first for her.holding her ass in my hands i lifted her to my mouth and tongue f**ked her while she mewled and writhed, her fingers digging into my scalp.her taste was unlike anything i'd ever savored before, salty sweet and fresh.she came on my tongue and filled my mouth with her sweet nectar.i had visions of eating her sweet pu**y for hours, just burying my face in her cunt until they carted me away.my c**k wasn't on board for that one though.i had to release one of her ass cheeks so i could squeeze him to get some relief."sorry baby, this is gon na be hard and rough, i can't wait any longer.climbing up her body i pulled her up higher on the bed and holding both her hands above her head, our eyes locked, i led my dick into her wet opening.she was tight as f**k and my c**k almost buckled.she flinched a little when i pushed the fat head of my c**k past her pu**y lips."fuck babe, you're so f**king tight."i had to raise her legs so i could sink more of my c**k home and even then i was only able to get eight of the twelve inches inside.she hissed and clenched around me, her eyes widening in surprise as i tried to force more of my meat into her tight as f**k pu**y."i'll try to go slow."lifting her ass i opened her pu**y more, screwing myself into her little by little until i was all in.it felt like hours instead of mere minutes when i was finally buried to the hilt inside her.as soon as my balls hit the crack of her ass i took her mouth.she fought to release her arms but i held firm.bending my head i sucked first one then the other nipple into my mouth, biting her in my lust crazed haze.she f**king flooded my c**k and screamed.i f**ked in and out of her like a beast, her pu**y's tight grip driving me insane.her legs came up and around my waist, drawing me in deeper with every thrust.i finally released her arms so i could touch her body and she clutched at me, her nails digging into my back.i couldn't seem to get deep enough in her, i wanted to imprint myself in her deeply, the thought moving me to lift her legs over my shoulders and bore into her."this is mine, no one else's ever again; only mine."i pushed my tongue into her mouth, not giving her a chance to answer.it wouldn't have mattered anyway; it was a done f**king deal.i felt the familiar tingle up my spine but fought off my orgasm.i didn't want to leave her body so soon, wanted to stay enclosed in her wet heat for eternity.when the bed started knocking into the wall behind us, and her grunts became long drawn out moans, i knew she was close again."cum for me baby."i latched onto her neck with my teeth and sucked hard, leaving my mark there before moving to the flesh right above her left nipple and doing the same.my sweet girl squeezed my c**k between her pu**y walls and i felt the heat of her pu**y juice as she bathed my c**k once more."yesssssss..." her long drawn out hiss only made the fever burn hotter.i wanted to f**k her from behind, but didn't want to leave her body long enough to change positions.instead i teased her little rosebud with my fingertip and felt the answering tightening around my cock; she liked that.i used the lubrication of her juices to coat my fingers and pushed one, then two into her ass up to the first knuckle.she almost bit off my tongue that i'd just shoved back in her mouth.the combination was too much for me and i roared into her mouth as i emptied my seed deep inside her.i wasn't done there though, i ground my pelvis into hers, flexing my still shooting c**k inside her.her response had me pulling my mouth away from hers to look down into her eyes.her eyes were glazed over and half closed, her mouth open in a silent scream; but it had been the electrifying shaking of her body beneath me that had caught my attention.she was sight of wantonness as i took her in, and i wasn't surprised to feel my c**k hardening once more inside her."can you take me again?"i asked the question but i knew there was no way i was stopping now.i had three days build up to work off.the sheets were already drenched beneath us as i bent my knees and pulled her up into my chest so we could reverse positions.i kept my knees bent behind her back as she sat up in the cradle of my lap, mu c**k going deeper up into her."give me your nipple baby."she leaned over like she barely had the strength to do even that and i sucked her nipple in hard as i used my hands on her hips to help her f**k herself on my cock.in the mirror across from the bed, i could see where we were joined, see the glistening length of my c**k as it slid in and out of her.her ass incited me to madness and i bit down on her nipple even as i sped up my thrusts, pounding up into her.she flooded my pelvis and lower stomach with more of her pu**y juice and i lost it, biting into her flesh as she rode out the storm with me."arggghhhh."i pulled her down hard one last time as my c**k spat more sperm inside her.she fell to the side limp, her hand cupping her pu**y as her body shook with after shocks.i was breathing like i'd just run a marathon, but i had enough strength in me to reach over and touch her.her body was on fire, and the way she rolled around clutching herself led me to believe i'd hurt her.i got off the bed after kissing her shoulder and headed into the bathroom to run her a bath when i got back into the bedroom she was just laying there looking dazed."is your pu**y sore?"she blushed and buried her face in the pillow.i grinned and picked her up and she did her kitten curl into my chest and nuzzled me.i kissed her hair as i walked us into the bathroom.i didn't trust myself to get into the tub with her, so instead i placed her inside and picked up the washcloth to bathe her.she hadn't said a word since i'd finished f**king her so and i was beginning to think she was poleaxed."you okay princess?"she turned glazed eyes my way and gave me a little half smile."what was that?""what was what sweetie?"i ran the washcloth over her tits, taking great care with her beautiful ni**les that were still semi erect, before working the cloth down her middle to her pu**y."that just happened in there."her face heated up again and i couldn't resist stealing a quick kiss."you weren't a virgin babe so i know you know what sex is."she started shaking her head before i was through speaking."that wasn't se trace, that was, wow, shit, wow..." she blushed and hid behind her hair."oh yeah?"i grinned at her as i used the washcloth to rub against her clit.she arched her back, pushing her cunt into my hand.i could actually feel her heat beneath the cloth as i cupped her pu**y mound.i dropped the cloth in the water and teased her swollen clit with my fingers while sucking her tongue into my mouth.so much for giving her a break!water went all over the floor as i lifted her from the tub.my c**k was at full staff and leading the ay as i cradled her in my arms and took her back to the bed.i walked around to the other side since that one was wet.thank f**k for king sized beds.again i didn't want to give up her mouth or her tits to f**k her doggie style so i took her down to the mattress with my body covering hers.reaching my hand between us, i used my c**k to rub up and down her slit, hitting her clit with each upward stroke and rubbing the sensitive underside of my c**k against her wet heat until i slipped into her in my last downward stroke."ohh..." her soft sigh broke the silence as i started f**king in and out of her, slowly this time.i told myself that i would go slow if it killed me, that i wouldn't hurt her.it was tough but i held on.with my face buried in her neck, i rode her nice and slow as she lifted up to meet my thrusts over and over again.i alternated between deep stroking into her and grinding my c**k into her belly.her legs opened wider and i slipped even deeper into her.it was a long time before i felt the familiar stirrings in my nuts again.her mouth was red and swollen from me eating at her lips and her neck was a mess from the five or six hickeys i'd given her.looking down at her my heart jumped in my chest with all the things i imagined doing to her.the last thought had me speeding up as i started pounding into her."you're not on birth control."i bit her ear after reminding her of that fact but there was more yet to come."you're ovulating."it's amazing what they can find in those medical tests these days.her breath caught as though she'd just thought of it, but even more telling was the way her cunt tightened around my shaft.i roared out loud as i shot a heavy load inside her, my last thought being that i'd lost my f**king mind.one look, it had taken one look at her to take me over.how was that even possible?for a man like me it wasn't even worth thinking on.i would never have believed in a million years that something like this could ever happen to someone like me.cynical, don't give a f**k and a beast in the boardroom; love and marriage was nowhere on my horizon; until three nights ago when i'd looked into her eyes across a stage.i stayed buried inside her as we came down so it was a minute or two before i realized that she was out.pulling out of her body, i drew her into my arms as i fell to my side beside her.the cool air of the ac dried my nuts as i pulled the sheet up over us and dropped into sleep.we awakened a short time later and took a shower to clean up and then had to take another after i violated her up against the shower stall.i hadn't planned to, but seeing her with water dripping down between her amazing tits and pebbled on her ni**les, it was pretty hard to resist.i was careful as i lifted her with her back to the stall and surged up into her, dropping her down on my length.it had been years since i'd f**ked anyone that long and that often, in fact i don't think i'd ever gone four times before and i still wasn't done.it was as if each time only whetted my appetite for more.and the way she responded to me, accepting and ready each time i took her."if you want to get any rest tonight and maybe wan na walk anytime soon, you'd better stop me."i whispered in her ear as i nibbled my way down to her neck and back.my c**k was still hard inside her and i'd just off loaded in her for the fourth time.her legs were still clasped around my hips as i kept her pinned against the shower.her answer was to pull my lips over to hers and smash her tits into my chest.as the water beat down on us, i took her down to the hard floor and started f**king her again."this is f**king insane."was it because i'd slept with her in my arms for three whole nights and not taken her?i couldn't think of a reason for this hunger that wouldn't be assuaged.the more i had her the more i wanted, but if we kept this shit up she'd spend the next three weeks bed ridden.already i had noticed the red puffiness to her labia and heard the slight sounds of discomfort she made even as she spurred me on to f**k her.i was sure i was killing her against the marble floor, the grunts and groans she made were becoming almost animalistic, but she threw her hips up at me taking my c**k like a pro as i did my best to nail her into her ground beneath us.this time when i came the roar was more like a grunt as i shook and thrust into her until i was dry."that's it, we're getting out of here, please try to keep your greedy hands to yourself shiane, my poor man's body can only take so much."she threw herself into my arms and howled with laughter and i felt my heart give a little more.we finally made it out of the bathroom and both just threw on robes as we headed down to the kitchen."did you say you made dinner?""yep."she went to the pots and pans on the stove and i lifted my brow quizzically.i guess i was guilty of stereo typing after all, i hadn't expected the little pop sensation to know her way around the kitchen.she'd made a dinner of grilled lamb chops of all things, with rice pilaf and creamed green peas."i hope i didn't spoil it."yeah right."nope, the lamb wasn't grilled yet, it's still sitting in the marinade it'll take five minutes to cook and the rest of the stuff can be reheated no problem.you just sit and i'll take care of everything," "yes ma'am."i opened a bottle of wine and poured her a glass, taking one for myself as i sat at the island and watched her flit around my kitchen.she seemed, happy.it was strange to look at this almost stranger and realize that already i'd come to know her so well.did she even realize that she'd started signing?she hadn't done that since she'd been here.i would've thought that she spent every waking moment singing, but this was the first time since i'd brought her home that i'd heard her so much as hum.it wasn't the song from the other night, this one was slow and dreamy, with a catchy little lilt to it that made me want to strain to hear the words since she was singing so low."sing louder princess i wan na hear you."she turned wide eyes to me and looked down at her feet."i'm not really good at that.""come again.""i mean i've learned how to control my fear somewhat before i go out on stage, but i can't really sing in front of anyone just like that.""so how do you do it?"'my manager gives me these pills..." i didn't like the sounds of that one bit."what kind of pills?"i lowered my glass and looked at her."it's nothing bad, just something to calm my anxiety.""is there a prescription?""no nothing like that, i never even asked him where he gets them..." "do you have them with you now?""no why?"she looked at me quizzically.""i'll just like to have a look at them that's all, make sure they're okay.""oh i'm sure they're fine doug would never do anything to hurt me.""so you have the pills back at your place?""no, doug keeps them with him, he gives me one before each performance or sometimes when i have to go on one of those talk shows.looks like i was gon na have to have a talk with her manager.she was so f**king green, i was sure it would never cross her mind to question anything the man did.though i didn't know him personally, i'm a businessman and i know all about the bottom line.her voice is like liquid gold, i'm sure dear old doug would do anything to see that nothing got in the way of her making them money.that was something else i was gon na have to look into as well.when i'd made the decision to own her, everything that she is became my responsibility.there might be some friction because i've noticed that she has a bit of an independent streak, but i had no intentions on letting that stop me.though i'd save it for another time, nothing was going to mar the night for us."voila, dinner is ready."she seemed nervous as she served me, and then herself.i closed my eyes with the first taste of the succulent lamb."wow, where did you learn to cook like this?""my mom taught me and i love watching the cooking channel, you really like it?"i took another bite and it was good as the first.nodding my head i leaned over and pecked her lips."it's amazing princess, wow."i kept the conversation light over dinner, asking her more about life on tour and what she enjoyed most about her fame.as far as i could tell she was more interested in the singing than anything else."um, trace, you weren't serious about that ovulating thing were you?"i'd almost forgotten about that, still wasn't quite sure what had possessed me to think of it much less say it.but now that she'd asked me outright... "as a matter of fact i am.it's crazy i know, and if one of my colleagues had come to me with this story i would tell him he's crazy.i have no explanation for it, the reality is that from the moment i saw you up on that stage something inside me shifted.""i find myself reverting back to childhood, to a time when i had to scrounge for every scrap i wanted or needed.when i became successful, i promised myself that i'd never go hungry again, and not just for food, but for any of those things i'd longed for as a child, or anything my heart may desire as an adult.""you're the first thing my heart's ever desired.i've known wants before don't get me wrong, but this, this is different.this goes beyond my own comprehension.like i told you before, this past weekend was about getting to know each other and i've gotten to know you.you wouldn't have come home with me had you not felt some of what i was feeling.i also know that you're more about hearth and home than the night life."i didn't tell her that i knew that's why she'd stayed with the ass**le who'd ended up cheating on her.i'd done some research after she was less than forthcoming about the reason for their split.it wasn't a known fact as yet but i had my ways of finding out things.i won't tell her that i knew though; it was her story to tell if and when she was ready.i did know that if i ever ran into the little prick, i was gon na beat the crap out of him for putting his hands on her though.it didn't matter that i didn't even know her when it happened, it's just the way i am, or at least it's the way i seem to be where she's concerned."but a baby?we hardly even know each other.""i don't think that whatever is going on here has anything to do with time and convention.either way, it's nothing to worry about now.what's done is done, and if it isn't, i'm gon na make damn sure that it is.the only problem is your upcoming tour, but i'm sure people have performed while pregnant before.""do you know how crazy this all sounds?"i shrugged my shoulders at her.i thought it was crazy too in the beginning so i couldn't fault her for having her own doubts.it was crazy when you looked at it, but it's what i felt and well... "i'm sure there have been people who got married after only one day of meeting or maybe two.i'm even more sure that there are people who get pregnant after just one meeting.look at this way; at least we both know where we stand.if the last few hours are anything to go by, we want each other more than a little bit and the bottom line is princess.i want you, in my life, with me, no matter what.so baby or no baby, you've met your future, so i suggest you get used to the idea.""what if i had other plans?""like i said, i've gotten to know you, and all that aside, this is what i want baby.as time goes on you'll find that i never let anything stand in my way, nothing and no one.dinner was delicious why don't you go find us something to watch while i clean up?"chapter 6 shiane i guess the conversation was over and what a strange one at that.i headed out of the kitchen on wobbly legs for the tv room to find something to watch, though i really didn't have much interest.my mind was awhirl with all the new things that were going on in my life.in the space of a few short days, it seems my life had been turned upside down.i find myself doing things that were totally outside the box for me.but this latest was a lot to take in, though the thought of it made me hot.trace was right.i've always only ever wanted to be a mother and a wife.i'd thought i would have that life with donnie, but was it possible to have it with this man that i'd only just met?what if he was just saying these things because like he'd said, he'd come to know me and knew that's just what i wanted to hear?how was it possible that he could want me like that after a chance meeting?i'd spent some time today looking for any and everything i could find about him on the net.the one thing that stood out except for his success as a businessman, was the fact that he had a different woman every couple of months.had he used this same line on them?somehow, he didn't strike me as the type.still, i had another worry.the things he'd made me feel.how will i live without them if this was all just a game to him?he'd made me feel things i never knew were in me.my body has never reacted this way before, and even though his size was a little uncomfortable, the pain was more a pleasure-pain than a real hurt.i felt myself creaming just thinking about it.could a man really make love to a woman that much without some kind of feeling involved?what if it was just lust?i'd seen pictures of some of the women he'd dated in the past and i have to say some of them were drop dead gorgeous, including the last one he'd been seen with a couple weeks ago.the though caused me a moment's doubt and i thought if ways to shield my heart this time, but i was afraid i might be too late.he'd taken me over completely, something i had no experience with.i hadn't the faintest idea how to handle a man like trace mckenzie.he was way out of my league.i heard him coming and searched through the stack of movies he had for something to watch."what's wrong?"he came up behind me and wrapped his arms around me from behind."what makes you think something's wrong?"i looked over my shoulder at him trying to put a brave face on."i wasn't sure when i first came in but now i'm certain it's all over your face."he pulled me towards the couch and down on his lap with his arms holding me close.for some reason i wanted to cry; he's been so kind and attentive in the time that we'd been together, what if it were all a farce?i had no idea that i'd started to cry until i felt his fingers wiping my cheeks dry."tell me what's bothering you sweetheart."i could only shake my head and cry harder as i buried my face in his chest."please don't play games with me trace, i can't stand it if you're just using me for some sick game..." i broke off when he lifted my face to his."baby!i forgot you don't know that much about men, only that boy you were messing around with.let me show you something."he stood up and took my hand in his, leading me out of the room and into the bedroom.standing me in front of the floor-length standing mirror, he removed my robe, dropping it to the floor, as i stood before him naked."you see those marks all over your neck and tits?do you know what those are called?""hickeys?""that's one word for it, they're also known as passion marks.i've never given one to a woman before.not since i learned what they meant as a young man.they may mean different things to different people.to me, they are a mark of ownership.""that's my mark on you.i put it there as a statement to you and anyone else who might see them, the ones on your neck anyway, anyone else sees the others, i'll heat up your little ass."his hand dropped to one in particular spot that was right at the tip of my pu**y."another thing, i don't think a man that's not really interested in a woman can f**k her five times if he didn't really mean it.""five?"i started counting on my fingers and got to four before i was being carted off to the bed.i looked up into his eyes as he laid me back and spread my legs before dropping his robe.his c**k was hard and red, with a string of pr**cum hanging from the end heading for the floor.trace i knew she had to be sore, but she also seemed to need reassuring and for now this was the best i could do.only time will convince her that this was the real deal.fuck i was just as confused as she was, but unlike her, i wasn't about to let doubts get in the way of what i wanted.taking her soreness into consideration, i dropped to my knees between her spread thighs and opened her pu**y lips gently with my fingers.she was a little red and puffy from too much f**king, but she was also getting wet.i licked her clit with the tip of my tongue, staying away from her pu**y slit for now."ooh..." i love how f**king responsive she is, the way she lights up as soon as i put my hands on her.i licked and sucked her clit until her juices started coming fast and furious.then i dipped my tongue into her pu**y, going slow so i could soothe the ache in her overused cunt.she gripped my hair and mashed her pu**y into my mouth before she filled my mouth with pu**y juice.when she came down from her climax i helped her up from the bed and folding her in my arms kissed her long and deep, sharing her taste with her.we tongue f**ked each others' mouths like starving wolves and my c**k was poking into her navel as she rubbed herself against me."suck me off baby."she slid down to her knees and studied my c**k before sticking out her tongue and licking the pr**cum from my cockhead.she's an enigma, all shy and blushing one minute and my little vixen the next.i had a moment of jealousy at the thought that she'd done this with that ass**le but let it go for now.i'm a very territorial f**ker, i knew i had to live with the fact that he'd had her but i needed to erase him from her memory.she licked along my shaft before sucking the fat head of my c**k into her mouth and sliding her mouth down my length until she'd taken me in as deeply as she could.i fisted her hair and waited until i was in her throat before i started thrusting in and out of her mouth, going slow at first, until i picked up the pace.pretty soon i was face f**king her and she was moaning around me cock.i looked down past her eyes that were staring up at me and saw that she had her fingers stuffed in her pu**y. i almost shot my load then and there.she did some kinda muscle spasm around my c**k and my toes curled.i pulled back so that i was no longer in her throat but on her tongue.i didn't warn her that i was about to cum, why would i?she was going to swallow unless i said otherwise, and the only time i'll do that is when i was in the mood to paint her face, her tits or the small of her back.she almost gagged on the first volley."easy, breathe princess."she soon got the hang of it and was swallowing fast enough in time to catch the next load.when my balls were empty and my knees were almost too weak to stand i helped her to her feet and took her to the bed."forget the movie baby, you need me to hold you."i laid down behind her with her much tinier frame completely covered by my arms and legs, cocooning her as i whispered in her ear."everything's going to be okay princess, i promise.if you've learned anything about me so far, you should know i'm not a man that plays games."but you've had girlfriends before; did you feel the same way with them?"her voice had gone all soft there at the end and i felt her body tense as if expecting a blow."let me ask you this; do you feel the same with me as you did with him?"now it was my turn to tense up as i awaited her answer.when it came, it went a long way of easing the green-eyed beast that had been trying its best to rear its ugly head."no, i've never... But it's not the same.you've had so much more experience and i'm sure i don't measure up to some of them.""that's where you're wrong sweetheart, first of all none of them ever came close and besides its about more than the physical.sometimes in life you find that one being that you can't live without, you may have sampled a lot along the way, but when you found the one, it's a whole new ballgame.""tell me, what did you feel that night when our eyes meet?"she turned around in my arms and looked up into my eyes."it was like being struck by lightning, or at least what i imagine that would feel like.i felt a jolt to my system and i think i forgot how to breathe for a minute.i almost panicked because for a split second i forgot the words to the song.""there you see?have you ever felt that before with anyone?"she shook her head and bit her lip.i could see the soft sheen of tears in her eyes and pulled her close to kiss her forehead."it was pretty much the same with me baby; so the next time you start doubting what we have, just remember those few minutes.now go to sleep, you've had a long day."i turned her back around intending to go to sleep, but by now my c**k was raging again."lift your leg baby."she lifted her top leg and i scooted down far enough to line up my c**k with her pu**y. i slid in and held still pulling her back firmly against my front."i'm not going to f**k you again tonight, we'll just stay like this until you fall asleep, you need your man to stay inside you to keep the doubts away."i was suddenly very tired, and it wasn't long before i fell asleep to the sound of her breathing evenly in sleep.in the morning, i awakened to her pushing her ass back against me with my c**k still lodged inside her.with my hand on her hip, i controlled the pace."can you take me hard or do you need me to go slow baby?"i nipped her ear as she flooded my cock."harder, please harder.""please what harder?"she didn't answer so i reached around and pinched her nipple."tell me or i'll stop."i held still and she tried to f**k herself on my cock.i pulled back as if i was going to leave her body."noooo, please, harder... Fuck me harder."fuck, i think that shit backfired on my ass, because her sweet voice saying those words triggered something inside me.leaning up on my elbow i reached my hand around and fingered her clit."put your arm behind my neck."she complied with my order and i bent my head to her nipple.she screamed and went off like a rocket from the dual pleasure, or was it triple?i f**ked into her hard as i played with her clit and sucked her nipple.i imagined my son or daughter nursing at her bountiful tits some day soon and the next time her pu**y clenched around me, i shot off inside her.it was harder than i imagined it would be to leave her the next day.chapter 7 for the next three weeks, we stayed hidden away in our lover's paradise.each day, i went off to work and left her home.and each night, i came home and after dinner, f**ked her into the wee hours of the morning.when it was time for her to go back to work, i thought i would lose my f**king mind.i didn't want to share her with anyone.i knew it was selfish; she had a life, a career that she loved."i want you to move in here with me."she didn't seem too certain, still fighting those doubts i guess."scratch that, i'll send a service over to help you pack up, but when i get home this evening your little ass better be here."i left before she could give me an argument.i was pissed off the whole day and didn't know why.in the last three weeks, i could pick up the phone and call her whenever i wanted.now she was busy doing her thing.i didn't like it one f**king bit.when had i become this person?i knew that what i felt for this girl was more than i'd ever felt before, but still, this overpowering need to possess her completely, to dominate her life, was new to me.her upcoming show was out of town and i wouldn't be able to make it because of the timing.i was going to be without her for two weeks while she travelled outside the country for a eight night show.she'd been going to the studio to rehearse the last couple of days coming onto the end of our time together, but she'd been there in the evenings.she never said what if anything her handlers had said about the arrangement, but that could be because i'd let her know one day when she tried to broach the subject that i really didn't give a f**k. i heard her as soon as i cleared the door that evening.good, that meant i didn't have to hunt her down and drag her ass back home.i'd half expected her to disobey my order to be here when i got home.there were boxes in the living room and i breathed a little easier.looks like i was getting my way after all."hey!"she was in the kitchen when i walked up on her.she hadn't heard me because she had earphones on.pulling them out, she looked up at me with her little shy smile.i knew she was fretting again about where we were going.i imagine moving in here with me was a big step for her.she'd never lived with a man before, and i had to keep reminding myself that she was young yet."did everything go okay with the move today?""yeah, i still have some stuff to bring over and some will have to go into storage.""did they give you any trouble with the lease?""uh about that... i'm not sure that i wan na give up the place just yet."i just looked at her not saying anything."when i asked you to move in here, did you think i meant for a few weeks or something?""no, i don't know.""take care of the lease shiane.or i will.don't forget, i'm a businessman.it makes no sense whatsoever for you to keep that place and pay the exorbitant rent for an empty apartment.i understand that you still have doubts and fears, but i'm not about to let them get in the way of things.i've spent the last three weeks trying to show you, but apparently that wasn't enough so you're just gon na have to decide if you want to take a chance at happiness or not.a word to the wise : i won't pay for someone else's short- comings.so if that's what this is about, you can kill that shit right f**king now."it seemed like we were about to have our first real argument there for a minute, but then she backed down.she needed me to take charge and i had no problem with that.she'd gone from under her parents' care, straight to this manager's handling, so basically, she's been told what to do her whole life.some people rebel against that, but with shiane, it was quite the opposite.she needed it.she left two days later for europe and i spent the time gathering as much information as i could on her manager and the other people around her.i didn't like that pill deal she'd told me about, and from some of the things she'd said, i wasn't too sure that her best interest was being taken care of.as her man, it was up to me to see that no one was taking advantage of her.and though our relationship had been spared the spotlight thus far, it was only a matter of time before word leaked out.and how would it look for wall street's whiz kid to be letting others take advantage of his woman?we talked every night after her show no matter what time it was, that was a stipulation that i'd made before she left.she could get away during the day because i knew she was busy with rehearsals, but at night i needed to know that she was safe.we did facetime until she fell asleep; each night, i could see that my baby was exhausted but she seemed to be having fun.there was a lot of buzz in the headlines about her shows but i didn't listen or read any of it.that was until two days before she was due back.my assistant was reading one of those crappy magazines that were filled with half-truths and innuendo.that's how i'd always seen them until i saw my woman walking out of some restaurant in italy with her ex.i didn't want to fly off the handle; the caption said the picture had been snapped the night before which had to mean it was before we'd spoken and she hadn't mentioned it to me.my first instinct was to get on a plane and got drag her ass home after dealing with both of them, but common sense and rationality won out.i couldn't go half way around the world to kill her.no, i'll wait'til she gets back and strangle her ass in the privacy of our own home.that night when she called, she still didn't mention it and i played like nothing was wrong.there was something in her voice but i wasn't quite sure what it was."so you've got your final show tomorrow night yes?""yes, and then i'll be home.""i'll be waiting."the next night when she called, i didn't answer.i'd spent the whole day in a contained rage and had pretty much locked myself away in my office.i'd come to terms with the fact that i didn't believe for a second that she'd cheated on me, but whatever reason she had for being with him was not good enough.and the fact that she hadn't mentioned it to me, only infuriated me more.she was home when i got in the next day.when she ran to me and jumped into my arms i held her close but didn't kiss her.she knew something was wrong and her eyes followed me across the room."is something wrong?""is there something you want to tell me shiane?"she looked at me at sea.i pulled out the magazine i'd had hidden in the drawer of the little side table and threw it at her.her eyes widened when she saw it and she looked up at me with fear in her eyes."it's not what it looks like.i can explain."i walked away from her and into the bedroom to remove my jacket and tie where she followed me a few seconds later."trace..." "were you the one that was afraid of me cheating on you?"she'd never seen me this way before, so she had no way of knowing that the precise movements and contained tone was a sure sign that her ass was in trouble."but i didn't cheat, he was on tour because we have a few duets together and..." "and you didn't tell me this because..." "i didn't want to cause any problems."she looked down at the floor and rung her hands."and the restaurant?""everyone was there that night.""did you talk to him?""i..." i saw the answer in the guilty look in her eyes."take off your clothes.""what?""now."she jumped and reached for the buttons on her shirt.i was naked by now and walked around to my closet.i came back out with my leather strap and she took one look at it and tried to make a run for it."you don't really want to make this any worst than it already is do you?"that stopped her in her tracks but she was still halfway out of the room."come here... Don't make me have to tell you again shiane."i almost caved when she turned big tear filled eyes my way.she took a deep breath to fortify herself and then walked slowly towards me with her head down.i didn't turn her over my knee.i was too angry for that.instead, i brought the belt down across her ass and thighs as she hopped from foot to foot pleading with me to stop."please trace nothing happened.""i don't want to hear it, you had your chance to tell me this shit before you left here."i gave her a good twenty hard blows with the belt until she was a crying slobbering mess.still not satisfied i left her there crying and walked out of the room.i went for a long drive to cool down but by the time i got back, i was still no better than when i left.she was in the middle of our bed with her arm locked around her bent knees rocking back and forth.we looked at each other but i still wasn't ready to talk to her.i felt betrayed; it was a new feeling for me.it had been a long time since anyone had had the guts to cross me.i headed into the shower in the hopes that the water would help to soothe my ragged nerves but no luck.she was wearing my old tee shirt, which she'd taken with her when she'd left."lose the shirt."she hurried to comply though i noticed her eyes fell to my hands to make sure she wasn't about to get another whipping.i climbed onto the bed and turned her around roughly.in the three weeks we'd bee together, as hard as i'd been f**king her, i'd always held something back, but not tonight, tonight i was going to give her the f**king i've been dying to but didn't because her little pu**y was still having trouble taking my cock.i didn't take the time to prepare her, this was a punishment after all, i planned to use her body tonight for my own pleasure until i'd freed myself of this burning rage.i had her bent over in the middle of the bed, her legs spread, head down and her pu**y in the air.licking my fingers i ran them roughly over her pu**y, dipping my middle finger into her wet heat before straddling her from behind.i didn't knee behind her, that wouldn't achieve my aim.i stood with my legs on either side of hers, slightly bent.from this angle i could drill down into her.i'm sure it would be a little harder for her to take me in this position but i really could give a f**k at this point.i ran my c**k ring up and down her slit until she started to get wet, then i slammed into her only giving her about half my length.she screamed into the mattress and her body shook but i didn't stop pounding until i was balls deep in her upturned pu**y.grabbing a fistful of her hair, i pulled her head back until i could see down into her eyes.i saw pain, but there was lust there as well as i battered her pu**y with my cock.when i felt her clenching, i pulled out and left her panting.she looked over her shoulder at me but she didn't have the nerve to say anything to me.when i was sure she wasn't about to cum, i screwed my c**k back into her, pulling her ass up higher to keep her at the angle i wanted.i kept pulling out to tease her with the piercing in the end of my c**k because i knew how much she loved that, but not giving her enough to get her off.the hoarse cries told me that i was hurting her, even as her pu**y got wetter and wetter."please trace.""not another f**king word."i tugged on her hair for emphasis and she bit her lip.she couldn't hide the f**k me noises that seemed to come from her gut, and her pu**y was on fire.i love those noises she made as i f**ked into her my c**k ring was hitting her just right and she started pushing back trying to get more of my twelve inches inside her.as pissed as i was i held off though, because i knew her tight little pu**y couldn't handle too much in this position, not so soon, it was going to take lots of f**king before that could happen without me tearing her.i pulled out and licked into her pu**y, going deep, she screamed and came in my mouth before i climbed back onto my feet and fed her eight inches of my meat.that's as deep as i could go before bottoming out inside her with her ass high in the air."as soon as i've broken in your tight little pu**y, i'm going to ass f**k you."she clenched around me and came again.i wasn't anywhere near cumming so i settled in for a nice long f**k. Her body was still shaking and her cries were dying down to low moans.she tried getting her hand under her to touch her sore pu**y but a hard smack on her ass stopped her in her tracks."don't do it."finally, i lowered her ass just a little and dropped to my knees behind her and the movement sent me all the way into her.it triggered another one of her magnificent climaxes and she squeezed my c**k like a vise.i bit into the flesh of her back to her neck before pulling her head back and to the side for my tongue."i love you trace."that stopped me mid stroke, the shock of it, but that didn't last too long."i love you too, but this isn't about that.you f**ked up.i'm pissed as f**k at you."i brought her off three more times until i felt my balls draw up to my body in preparation to blast."you don't deserve my seed."i pulled out and pushed her away from me.she turned around in time to watch me jerk my seed into the sheets.her cry of dismay cut through the air as i climbed off the bed and headed to the shower.i was only in there two minutes when i felt her come in and stand in front of me.i kept my head back and eyes closed as i ran the cloth over my chest."trace, i'm so sorry.i wasn't thinking.i won't do it again.i promise."she was crying as her hands came up to touch me tentatively.i finished my shower without saying a word to her and walked away.i stripped the bed after drying myself off and putting on a pair of boxers.she was coming out of the shower by the time i was finished remaking the bed she looked at me as i passed her and left the room.in the kitchen, i ignored the dinner she'd made and made myself a sandwich before shutting myself away in my private office.it was hours before i felt human again.i'd called the detail i'd had following her unbeknownst to her and got the same story from them.that eased my anger some but there was still the issue of why she didn't tell me that her ex was going to be on this trip.from what they'd said, he'd been hounding her the whole time she was there but she'd seemed disinterested.like i said, i never thought she'd cheated on me with him; i still didn't want her having anything at all to do with him.along with that, the reports on her manager weren't looking too good.it was just as i'd suspected, he was using the young girl for his own gains.she had been robbed of a good three million dollars in the two years she'd been signed.money from different venues that i'm sure she wasn't even aware of.she wasn't hurting for money, not by a long shot, but still it wasn't for him or anyone else to rip her off.before i confronted him though, i was still waiting for the results of the in depth investigation of everyone that had anything to do with her career.she was curled into a ball on my side of the bed when i finally upstairs hours later.i stood over her for the longest time until i felt my heart settle.i wouldn't have chosen a moment of anger in which to tell her that i loved her, but she'd chosen the time and place.now it was out there, i'd shown her my heart, as well as giving it to her.we could never go back now, from here on out we were one and for me that meant a whole lot of shit.she'd only gotten a taste of the man tonight, if she f**ked up in the future it could be worst.turning away, i walked to my side and climbed in with my back to her.she must've gravitated to me in her sleep, because i woke before the sun the next day to find her curled into my back.lifting my arm, i turned and pulled her into my arms.she was barely awake when i turned her to her back and slipped into her wet heat.she clutched at me in her sleep before she came fully awake."trace..." her voice was that of a little girl lost."shh, it's okay i'm here."i pushed her hair back so i could look into her eyes as i stroked my c**k in and out of her."wrap your legs around me princess."she lifted her legs around my waist pulling me in deeper.i never took my eyes off of hers; i wanted to see what was there, what words could never say because there weren't enough.when i came i captured her lips with mine and accepted her moans into my lungs as she gave me her sweet nectar."i love you."she tightened around me and cried out at my admission.chapter 8 things settled down somewhat after that and we lived a life of peaceful bliss for the next month and a half.i took her away on my jet for long weekends.we played, we laughed we enjoyed each other and the more time went by, the more in love with her i became.i no longer questioned the strangeness of our meeting, or why it had been so easy for me to make the decisions i had after so many years of living and thinking one way.she was my beautiful girl, the owner of my heart.her career was doing extremely well, her records were going platinum all over the place and she was in high demand.she had another local show coming up this weekend.this time i was ready when she approached my hesitantly to let me know that her ex was going to be performing at the show.i had had time to prepare myself since i'd already gotten a line-up of what was in store for that night.i've been following her career since the day we met and now i have all the information i needed to send her manager and a couple lawyers to jail.i haven't told her what i'd found as yet.didn't want to upset her this close to her performance and i'd only just got the last of the result.it had taken this long because the lawyers had been very slick with their thievery.too bad for them i know how to follow the money trail, all i need is the scent.i planned to tell her this weekend after the show though and i already had my lawyers on standby to take care of shit.shiane trace has been so unbelievably amazing in the last month or so.it's like everyday he goes out of his way to relieve my fears.maybe it's because we were able to keep our romance out of the public eye, but i was having more fun being in love with him than i'd ever thought possible.i decided to take a page out of his book and try to really get to know him.i'd watch him when he wasn't looking, and paid attention to the little things, like how he shielded my body with his whenever we were going somewhere.how he always seemed to have to touch me whenever we were together no matter where we were; or the way he'd run his hand through my hair absentmindedly while we sat together watching a movie.i especially loved the way he made love to me.ever since that night when he'd punished me, which now when i think back on it was hot as hell; he's been this super boyfriend though it seems kinda weird thinking of him in that way, he's so much more than a boy.i'd told my family about him and dad and him had had a few private conversations over the last few weeks that i wasn't privy to, but my family seemed to love and accept him even with the age difference.now i have a show coming up tonight and i'm more nervous than usual.not because of the show itself, no, trace had taken care of that as ell.he'd found this lady that specialized in curing people like me.she just put me through this series of exercises that helped to calm me down before each appearance.it was an ongoing process but so far it seemed to be working.i no longer had that sick fear of bombing on stage.no tonight's fear stemmed from the fact that donnie was there and i knew form our last one sided conversation that he was going to try to get back with me again.because trace and i had been able to keep our relationship hidden, he along most of the known world were under the impression that i was still pining for him.then there were the rumors of us sneaking around together.one tabloid had gone so far as to print that very suggestion.i thought trace would lose his mind.he'd gone on a tear even going so far as to call up someone to handle the retraction and fire the person responsible.i guess it wasn't just the speculation that had sent him over the edge, but the fact that there was a photo shopped picture from the year before of me and donnie, only this one was made to look like it was more recent and well, let's just say it didn't sit well with trace to see his woman as he put it, lip locked with some other dick.apparently whatever he'd done had worked because the following week there had been a retraction and an apology.will wonders never cease?of course now we were down to crunch time.he'd said that he was fine with the whole show deal but as the time drew nearer i could see that tic in his jaw working overtime.all i could do was hope for the best."shiane baby come in here."trace her show was in a couple hours and she'd have to leave soon for prep.i'd made peace with the fact that she was going to be sharing the stage with the ass**le ex for part of tonight's show.although i'd told her that i was fine, the truth is that i'm not the kind of man who could ever be okay with such a thing, but the contracts had been signed long before i came on the scene and it was her career.i was going to make sure that this was the last time though.after this series of engagements were over, there will never be another occasion when she would be allowed even in the same room as the prick.she came into room already dressed to leave.i didn't say anything to her as i pulled her into my arms and fed her my tongue.my hand went down to her pu**y and she opened her legs to give me easier access.i rubbed her through her clothes as her breathing sped up and she smashed her tits into my naked chest.wordlessly i started to strip her clothes away as my c**k grew and pr**cum started leaking from my tip.i had her spread out on the bed with my head between her thighs as i ate her pu**y, making sure to sink my tongue as deep as i could as i fingered her ass.over the past weeks i've been preparing her ass for my cock.she moaned and pushed her pu**y harder against my mouth.her juices ran down to the crack of her ass lubricating her nicely.standing from between her legs where her pink pu**y was on full display with her juices glistening and calling to me, i helped her onto her hands and knees in the middle of the bed.i teased her pu**y slit with my c**k head until pushed her ass up higher and begged me to f**k her."please trace."i slapped her ass once hard and she looked over her shoulder at me.her eyes were already glazed over and i knew she was already far-gone."please what?""fuck me, f**k my pu**y hard."yes, that's something else i'd taught her, to be less inhibited in bed.at first her shyness ruled her, but i soon had her saying and doing anything she loved.i'd explained to her that since i was the only sexual partner she'd ever have for the rest of her life, who better to know what pleased her?and how will i know if she didn't tell me?that had opened up a whole new world to her, and i'd learned a lot about my princess.she had a bit of the submissive in her, she liked for her man to take charge, not just in the bedroom either.it was perfect since i'm a controlling bastard and make no bones about it.i teased her pu**y some more before sinking my c**k all the way home.she arched her back and came like she always does as soon as i enter her.she says it's because i hit her cervix each time and it triggers her.i f**ked into her nice and slow, using my hand in her hair and the other on her hip to control her movements.looking down between us i enjoyed the sight of my c**k covered in her pu**y cream as it went in and out of her."your pu**y's still so tight baby, f**k." she lowered her head to the mattress which sent her ass even higher into the air and had my c**k going in deeper and at a different angle.getting to my feet, i released her hair so i could hold both her hips and pull her back hard on my c**k as her pu**y opened and closed around my cock.i could see where my c**k was bulging out around the lips of her pu**y, the way they pulled out when i came out and folded in when i f**ked back in.i knew she still couldn't too much of a pounding in this position so it was slow going until she juiced all over my cock.i didn't want to cum in her pu**y just yet though i had other plans for tonight.pulling out after she'd come down, i licked her pu**y deep while using my fingers to rub our mixed juices into her tight ass**le.she flinched and moaned as she pushed back against my fingers trying to get me to go deeper.i probably should've used a little sex toy on her ass to prepare her for my twelve inch cock, but i didn't want even a fake dick anywhere near her.reaching off to the side i got the lube and oiled up my cock.she looked over her shoulder to see what i was doing and her eyes widened."trace?""shh, it's okay."i ran my hands up and down her back around to her tits where i pulled and pinched them the way she likes.i kept letting my c**k tap into her pu**y lips and her clit, which kept her preoccupied.when i was sure she was ready, i leaned over her back, then i had a thought."did he f**k you in the ass?"i had wrapped my hand around her throat unknowingly, it was only when she shook her head no that i realized what i'd done.i didn't think she'd ever anal before but i wanted to be sure, it was the reason i'd chosen tonight after all.satisfied with her answer, i guided my c**k as gently as i could to her ass.she was tight as was to be expected so i had to take me time and work my c**k into her ass in one-inch increments.she tensed and her body tried to expel me but i soothed her with soft kisses around her ear and down her neck, whispering how beautiful she was and how much i loved her.her ass relaxed enough for me to get a few inches in her and then i started the f**king motion in and out of her.i'm not really big on anal sex, but it was enjoyable on some occasions.the more she relaxed, the more dick i fed her until i was balls deep in her ass.she was really getting into it now pushing her ass back hard against me until i was lying flat on her back pressing her into the bed.her ass was the tightest f**king thing i'd ever felt around my cock, and that was saying something because my baby has a tight cunt."when you're on stage with him, i want you to remember who you belong to."i slammed into her ass and her mouth opened in a soundless scream.i f**ked her to two orgasms but i myself didn't want to cum in her ass.instead i pulled out and with a stern'stay as you are', went into the bathroom to clean off my rock hard cock.coming back to the bed, i rolled her over onto her back and climbed between her legs pushing them farther apart with my hips.i looked down at what i was doing as i led my c**k into her pu**y again.i didn't hurry; i knew i was f**king with her because she should've been gone half an hour ago.i didn't care; this was my way of showing her who was in charge."trace, we have to hurry i have to..." i caught her neck in my hand and surged into her hard."don't rush me, we're through when i say we are."i kissed her then, sending my tongue deep into her as i f**ked her nice and slow making her forget that she was way late.she f**ked back at me her hips going wild as i kept teasing her with small strokes instead of the pounding she needed."if he touches you, i'll kill him."she looked into my eyes before hers rolled back in her head and she came.it was soon too much for me and though i didn't pound away at her like i always want to, i f**ked her to another climax as my balls unloaded in her womb.i bit into her neck just as the last of my sperm was spilling into her.i smirked down at my handy work.let the little f**k think about that.chapter 9 she sat practically in my lap in the car on the way to the venue.her manager was not pleased to say the least and started in screaming until i told him to get f**ked."who are you?hey aren't you..." i didn't bother to answer the f**ker as he stared from me to her and back.she headed off to do her thing and i walked away from him, i wasn't ready to deal with him right now.i stood around backstage until it was almost time for the show to begin then went out and took my seat in the front row.i'd debated on whether or not this was a good idea, watching her perform with him, but in the end she'd pleaded with me to come.i guess it was best if i were here in the flesh to see what the hell the performance was like than reading about it second hand in some rag.the buzz was that they were dy***ite on the stage, that they had great chemistry and all that other bullshit.i settled in for a long night.i felt a huge sense of pride when she came out the first time and the crowd went wild.this was a much larger crowd than the one from the night we met and the whole place was on their feet.you would never know that less than two hours ago i had her bent over.she didn't look at all nervous and in fact seemed to be glowing.it was halfway through, when i'd finally felt the tension leave me and had relaxed and start to enjoy the show that he joined her on stage.the song was one of those dual tone numbers, slow in parts and fast in others.i felt my fist fold the first time he had to get real close to her as they faced each other across the microphones.then ensued a sort of cat and mouse dance.he kept trying to put his arms around her waist or on her hip.i wasn't sure if that was part of the actual dance routine or just him being an ass, but the first time she threw a panicked look my way i knew it was a bit of both.the crowd seemed to read something else into it, as it appeared that she was playing hard to get, evading his roving hands and prancing away as she continued singing, only to be followed by him time and again.each time our eyes met i kept my face neutral, i didn't want to spoil her performance and like i said if this was part of her job then so be it.but what i didn't like was the way he tried to manhandle her on the stage when it had nothing to do with their routine.don't ask me how i knew those times so well.i was reading her body language sure, but each time it happened she'd send me a look and it would tip me off.i wasn't mad at her though, not really, but him i'd like to stomp into the f**king mud.i left my seat and headed backstage just before the last number ended.i cold hear the roar of the crowd as she bid them goodnight for the second time after giving them the encore they'd asked for.i was in the shadows sort of, behind this huge potted plant, when she came back followed by the rest of the band, and the ass**le. "hey i'm talking to you."he reached out to grab her arm and she pulled it out of his reach."the show is over donnie we have nothing more to say to each other for the rest of the night.""that's what you think.where did you get this?"he tried touching the mark i'd left on her neck.she slapped her hand over it and backed up."that's none of your business.""it is my business when my woman is sporting a hickey from some other dude.""your woman, are you insane?we've been over for months now would you please get out of my way?"she tried going around him and by this point i'd seen all i needed to.i started forward but before i could reach them he'd reached out and grabbed her and was trying to kiss her.the amazing this was that there were others heading backstage and no one seemed to witness the almost assault that was taking place right in front of them.that could be because their voices had been kept low throughout this whole exchange.as soon as his hand fisted in her blouse i was on him."get the f**k off her ass**le."i flung his hand away and got between the two of them.you could say i was pissed but trying to contain it.i was no longer angry about the display on stage, i knew that was all him and though the world might see a very well coordinated dance routine, that's all that it was.but this was something more, this was personal and this i would not allow."who the f**k are you, shiane who's this ass**le?is he new security?tell him who i am before i sue his ass.""listen you little shit, if you come anywhere near her again i'll break every bone in your f**king body."he looked at her wide eyed when he realized i meant every word.then he stupidly reached out for her again, grabbing her hand this time and i saw red.i punched him in the face until blood spurted from his mouth.only the fact that he was so much younger than i, kept me from following through.i grabbed her hand and pulled her out behind me mad as hell.i didn't have a jacket to give her this time but thankfully she was more covered up."did you leave anything back there that you needed?"i asked her after we were in the back of the car on the way home.she called one of her assistants to gather her shit.that night i f**ked her like a beast, there wasn't any part of her body that i didn't lick bite or kiss.at one point she'd cried because it was too much.i ate her little pu**y until the sting was eased and then slid back into her.we were both sore by the time i rolled away from her as the sun was rising.dragging her into my arms i cuddled her as we slept.the next day i was all over the f**king front page, just what i needed.some hack had been there taking pictures of the whole thing and the story broke.that's how we were found out and since that night we couldn't leave the house for weeks without a camera in our face.things cooled down when they realized they weren't gon na get anything more from us and my security was very good at evading their asses.they had no access to my private underground parking garage and since i had a whole fleet of cars to choose from they never knew which one we were in if i felt like taking my woman out for dinner.since i didn't frequent the kind of establishments that catered to the paparazzi or that hired people who'd tip them off to us being there, we were left relatively in peace after the hubbub had died down chapter 10 now it's the night of the last show and she was pissing me off.we'd had an argument of sorts that morning, well i wouldn't call it an argument exactly but there was definitely some tension.we were lazing around having breakfast doing our usual thing, which was something the therapist had told her was helpful for her anxiety.i was reaching over to pour her some orange juice when she sideswiped me."trace are we gon na get married?"she caught me off guard with that one, coming out of the blue like that and i guess i didn't handle the situation to her liking."why don't we talk about this later after you're done with the show?"it was the best i could come up with on such short notice.for some reason my answer pissed her off.she'd been showing her mettle a lot here lately once she realized i wasn't the type to fold my fist and punch her in the face just for kicks.after she asked me that she got all quiet for the rest of the day and when she wasn't slamming shit around the house she was ignoring me.i decided to leave her to her mad and do some work in my office.two hours before she was due to leave i cornered her in the shower and f**ked her against the stall although she'd tried to give me shit at first."mine, you don't tell me no ever no matter how f**king pissed you are."i had my hand covering her wet crotch when i said that and moved it away to enter her swiftly.as much of a fuss as she'd made by the time i had her pinned to the wall, her legs were wrapped around my waist and her fingers were digging into my scalp as i f**ked her to within an inch of her life.she'd cleaned my c**k off after i'd off loaded inside her the second time and we'd cleaned each other up after so i was under the impression that she was over her mad.now she pulled this f**king stunt.we'd had a few conversations about the way she dressed on stage and when she let it be known that she wasn't too comfortable with some of the costumes either but her wardrobe people chose them, i'd put my foot down.her talent didn't need any gimmicks.i didn't expect her to dress like a nun on stage but neither did i expect her to show her ass to the world, not when that ass was now the exclusive property of trace mckenzie.i waited until the number was almost at an end and she would be headed backstage for a clothes change.i caught her as soon as she got off the stage and while her helpers were waiting to help her change i dragged her off to the dressing room and locked the door."your next outfit had better be something more presentable shiane, or i swear to f**k, i will drag your ass off that f**king stage and take you home.""don't tell me how to do my job trace, i was doing this before we met and if you don't like it..." my hand came up and went around her throat and i pulled her face close to mine."watch what the f**k you say to me little girl, i'm holding onto my temper by a thread, so unless you want me to heat up your little ass when we get home you'd better quit while you're ahead.""maybe i won't be going home with you."she was pissed and obviously not thinking too clearly because of it or she would've been more careful.i laughed in her face."try it, there isn't a hole or rock big enough to hide your ass.and if you get any one of these f**kers around here to help you hide from me i will destroy the f**k." i kissed her hard enough to bruise her lips before leaving her there.i knew what she wanted but she was just going to have to wait.i'm a man and for a man there's always the right way and a wrong way to do things.i headed back out my seat and that's when she really did it.i thought i'd made my point when i saw the long dress with the slit up the front.but then one of the male dancers came up behind her and wrapped his arm around her from behind while she sang to him and they did some sorta two- step dance.then he did something with his hand and the dress was at her feet.she kicked it out of the way as the crowd went wild.she had the nerve to dead at me was she sang and then and shook her ass at the crowd.i thought there was going to be a riot.i sat there for the rest of the set until she left the stage for the last time.by now my rage was a cool controlled anger simmering inside me.i said nothing as i went backstage where everyone was congratulating her on her performance."let's go."i walked over and took her elbow.""wait i have to..." one look at my face had her changing tact.she swallowed hard and i could see from her expression that she was finally getting that she'd gone too far.all the way in the car i sat away from her while she kept shooting me furtive looks.i kept my face straight ahead and my fists clenched as they hung between my thighs.if i did anything else i'm afraid i might strangle her ass.as soon as we got through the doors of home i grabbed her arm and headed for the bedroom and straight to where i kept the belt i used to wail her ass."stop trace you can't."she tried to pulling away from me which only enraged me more.i grabbed the belt and was about to bring it down over her ass, not even waiting to get her undressed i was so pissed."i'm pregnant."well f**k, that sure stopped me in my tracks."what did you say?""you can't spank me, i'm pregnant."i dropped the belt and stared down at her.there was something strange going on with my heart.it was beating yes, but the rhythm was off somehow.i felt a buzzing in my ears and i thin i lost sight there for a second."you're pregnant?"i pulled her around to stand in front of me.she nodded and looked down at her feet."why didn't you tell me?""i just found out, i was going to tell you, then i asked you that question this morning and you blew me off."the memory seemed to renew her anger and she glared at me."i wasn't about to try to trap you with a baby, i don't want to marry someone who doesn't really want me for me, i've had one ass**le in my life already."i grabbed her neck and lifted her off her feet."i told you never to throw that f**ker in my face.just because you're carrying my child do not think for one minute that i won't heat your little ass up."what the f**k ever gave you the idea that i didn't want to marry you?""you said..." she raised her voice and started to yell."watch your f**king tone, you're skating on thin f**king ice.what the f**k ever gave you the idea that i'm the kinda man who needs his woman to propose to him?that's my place, not f**king yours no matter what some feminist new age f**k says.""well it didn't look like you were gon na ask, now if you do, i'll always know it was only because of your precious child."i dragged her into the closet and over to the safe i kept hidden there.it took me a few tries to get the combination i was that f**king pissed.opening the safe i retrieved the little velvet box i'd kept there for months."i bought this two days after we met.i was waiting for you to be finished with this before giving it to you."trace i..." "save it, i told you once i won't pay for what that ass**le did to you.not that that's clear let's talk about that shit you pulled tonight.""i thought you didn't want me, i thought..." "so you thought to get back at me by doing something that was sure to piss me off.just a warning for the future babe, you do not ever want to piss me off.i'll be lenient with you when it comes to certain things, but outright disobedience will not be acceptable, not now not ever."you want me to leave your ass you pull a stunt like this again.if i say no it means f**king no do you hear me?""yes."she mumbled."i'm sorry.""you're too f**king spoilt for your own good.i'm not sure if i should let this slide, but i don't want the news of my child's conception to be marred by this f**kery, and since you've spoiled my proposal you can live with that shit."i took the box from her hand and put the five-carat diamond on her finger.this was not how i'd wanted this to go.i'd had everything planned out.i was going to take her to paris since that was her favorite place and propose to her there in one of their over priced swanky restaurants.that's not my style but it's hers so i was willing to do it to make the night special.i didn't make love to her that night.not because of any punishment or anything like that, i think i was just overwhelmed a little if you wan na know the truth.i'd gone from extremely pissed and ready to heat up her ass, to learning that i was going to be a daddy or a dad.instead i helped her get ready for bed and held her as she gave into the fatigue of the long day and night.once again i recalled my childhood, the always wanting, never having and never any hope of having.and the hunger, humiliation, all the things you can expect from a young boy whose parents neglected him.and then when lily came along, my beautiful little sister, i remembered the fear in my gut that i wouldn't be able to protect her.she was the one and only baby i'd ever held in my arms, and the love i'd felt then, couldn't be compared to what i felt for the unborn child shiane now kept safe in her womb.i thought of her upcoming tour and knew there was no way i would let her go off on her own, not in her condition.i came to the conclusion that it was time i delegated more at work.i had men and women that i'd hired, the best in their fields, sometimes straight out of college, but had yet to trust anyone to do what i did.it was an easy decision to make now, whereas before the thought gave me cold sweats.i took the hand with my ring on it and kissed her finger as i hoped and prayed that i would get this right, then being as gentle as i could and not awaken her.i lowered my body until my lips were in line with her still flat stomach and made a promise to my son or daughter."daddy will always be there little one, no matter what; i can't wait to meet you."i felt the tears gather at the corner of my eyes, and though it had been years since i'd shed one, i let them fall.my heart had never been so full in my life.i held her until the dawn and that's as long as i could hold out before taking her.turning her silky soft body onto her back, i kissed my way down her body, stopping at her br**sts.i took the nipple of first one into my mouth, licking and sucking, pulling strong as i imagined one day my baby would, before going to the other.by the time i made my way down to her sweet cunt, she was writhing beneath me.i licked her clit until it was peeping out from under its hood, then spreading her pu**y lips open, i closed my eyes and feasted on her flesh, her taste bursting into my mouth as i dug deep with my tongue.sliding up her body, i slid into her going deep with one smooth thrust.her eyes were sleep-warm as she looked up at me.with my hands holding both sides of her head, i held it back so i could look into her eyes as i loved her."i love knowing my child is inside you."i let one of my handles cover her stomach between us for a brief moment before gathering her in close."give me your mouth baby."she lifted her lips to mine and we stayed like that, our lips locked together passionately as i worked my c**k in and out of her, her hips rising and falling with my thrusts.it was the most amazing experience of my life so far, and there was so much more to come.i'll make sure of it.epilogue he's utterly unpredictable and totally insane my husband.i don't think i've ever known a more volatile person in my life.my dad was an easy going mild mannered man, sure he and mom had their tiffs over the years when we were growing up, but i doubt he's ever done or said half the things has done to me.like spanking her ass with a belt.since my announcement of my pregnancy, he's added one other element, over protectiveness.don't get me wrong, i love it, in fact i think i need it because my hormones have been out of whack from day one; but i wondered how others would see him.it started with my management team of all things, and a couple of the lawyers that handled my contracts.the morning after our engagement, he'd dropped the bombshell that they had been robbing me blind.i'd sat there dumbfounded, not having the first clue as to what i was supposed to do next."don't worry princess i've got it covered."'but how did they and why?""the how is easy, you don't know what you're looking at when dealing with those things unless you've done some kind of business class or you have someone reliable explain it to you."he was right i guess, as a small town girl, seeing all those zeros on my account balance was enough for me, i was just happy doing what i loved most and the fact that i was actually being paid, well."the why is that they're greedy f**ks and they saw you coming a mile off."i guess they never banked on trace mckenzie coming into my life and turning everything upside down.i'd wanted to do everything secretly after that, didn't want the brouhaha that would follow if the public got ahold of it.trace wanted to burn them at the stake.in the end he convinced me that it was best to go public so that they wouldn't be free to do it to others.turns out that was the right call, because after the story broke, others had come forward after realizing that they too had been victims of these unscrupulous men.my tour started when i was five months along.trace somehow found the time to leave work for almost two months and accompany me.i'd had to do some rearranging which meant there were hardly any breaks in between cities, but i wanted to be done before i really started to show.that's when i saw the other side of him.he'd hired all new management for me when i told him i wasn't sure what to look for.he'd threatened to fire my wardrobe staff until they had some kind of meeting and he got what he wanted.in the end they'd come up with more tasteful designs, though some of them were sexier than the ones i'd worn before.he was right you didn't have to be half naked on stage to get your point across.one day we were sitting at the kitchen table, i was still sitting in his lap because we'd just made love while our breakfast had grown cold.as he slipped out of my body i'd said,'you know we can do the proposal thing over'.he'd given me one of his looks and that was that.i guess that ship had sailed.i can't say that i felt deprived though, because in every way he was the perfect fiance and then husband.our wedding was a very private affair in my hometown.he'd moved heaven and earth to make it so and it was beautiful.he was completely fascinated with my body these days, especially after i started to show.there wasn't a day that went by that he didn't spend at least an hour playing with my tummy and having these long drawn out conversations with whoever was in there.now though, i think he'd reached his limit."trace it hurts."he leaned over me as he held my hand in his and brushed my hair back with the other."i know baby, i know it will be better soon.do something."that last was said to the doctor and nurses that were there in the delivery room.he hadn't shouted the words that they carried more force than if he had.the way he seethed them through clenched teeth and glared at the room's occupants.if i weren't in so much pain i would've found it funny."she's coming along just fine mr. mckenzie.just one more push shiane, that's a good girl."i bore down with all my might as trace held my hand and whispered in my ear how proud he was of me and how beautiful i was.i think it was his voice more so than anything urging from the doctor that gave me the extra boost i needed to push my son out into the world.i laughed and cried as i heard his loud wails fill the room.trace never took his eyes off mine until the oh-oh from the doctor."oh-oh?no f**king oh-oh, what the f**k is oh-oh?"he was ready to tear the poor woman's head off before she explained.i was in too much of a daze from the new pain wracking my body to help."looks like we have another one."and so my daughter was born, totally unexpected but completely loved.the end chapter one i bounce from foot to foot as i try my mom's cell phone one more time.i'm practically bursting at the seams wanting to tell her my good news, and she's not answering.i hang up the call as it goes to her voicemail again.she's been a little more unreachable ever since she started dating this new mystery man.she'll have to break down and tell me about him soon-we've never been able to keep secrets from one another for long.i give up and hold down the number 2 button on my old flip-phone to auto-dial my best friend allison.thankfully, she picks up."i got it!i got a lawn room!"i shriek as soon as she answers, my excitement overflowing into a wild jig around my tiny dorm room.allison screams on the other end in response-she knows what a huge deal this is for me.there are only fifty-four lawn rooms at the university of virginia, where i'm just finishing my junior year.they were a central part of thomas jefferson's design for the school, and spread out under white columns from his famous rotunda.they might be small and drafty, but living in one is a high honor.there's a rigorous application process, and they are given to only the most academically-deserving rising seniors.i worked my nerdy butt off in preparation for this moment, and i can barely believe it's actually happening."wait, wait, i'm putting you on speaker.miriam's here, too," allison says when she finally takes a breath.miriam is the third member of our little group that i met freshman year, and has both supported me and sheltered me through the first three years of college."brynn, i'm so proud of you!i mean, think of how many hundreds and hundreds of hours you worked for this moment!"she gushes.i laugh."don't remind me!"i wince, thinking of how much of college life i've missed while huddled in the back stacks of the library.not that miriam and allison are academic slouches either, far from it, all three of us could probably draw you a map of the library from memory."and if it gets too cold in the winter, you can always come crash with us," allison adds.she and miriam have been roommates since sophomore year, and will be again next year.they've always invited me to apply for housing with them, but after freshman year, i decided i was too much of an introvert for roommates."the fireplace is probably the best and worst part of the whole thing," i laugh.the lawn rooms have almost no trappings of the modern world, so in the winter all you have to keep yourself warm is your own personal fireplace.it sounds romantic now, but come next january, i imagine i might feel differently."are you working tonight?or can we celebrate?"miriam asks.i work in the cafeteria as part of my work-study program to offset the cost of my tuition."maybe we could go to dinner together, then see a movie?""well, i'm not working," i admit, guilt already bubbling up from my stomach, "but i was thinking i might go out with these girls from my poli-sci class."there's a short silence before allison speaks."oh, cool... sounds fun.what are you guys going to do?""um, they invited me to this party at the crew house," i say, beginning to tug on the ends of my dark blonde hair-a nervous habit that only really gets out of control during finals."the crew house!?"allison exclaims, and i can't help but roll my eyes at her theatrics."brynn, you know as well as we do that those parties get insane!i heard that last semester nine of their varsity members got alcohol poisoning in one night!""well, there are only eight on a team, so i think that might be an exaggeration," i murmur."though i suppose maybe an alternate-" "brynn, the point is, those parties are notoriously crazy," miriam cuts in."i just want to see for myself," i say, trying to keep the frustration out of my voice."i'll call you guys tomorrow morning.""ok..." allison says warily."bye!"i say quickly, before miriam can renew her argument, and hang up.as wonderful as my two best friends are, i do get tired of how uptight they can be sometimes.not that i don't understand where it comes from.the three of us weren't exactly popular during high school, and when we found each other during our freshman year orientation, it was such an amazing relief to be with like-minded girls.we were all serious students, driven, with a penchant for fantasy books that might star viggo mortensen in the movie adaption.but now, i'm beginning to chafe at the boundaries of our friendship.particularly when it comes to going out to parties, and boys.on my early morning trips to the library, i see girls doing the walk of shame across campus, their makeup smeared across their faces, hair rumpled, and first i feel pity, and then intense jealousy.that post-sex glazed over look... if i'm honest with myself, i want that too.and i promised myself that if i got my lawn room, i'd go to a party.a real college party.the kind miriam and allison roll their eyes at as they wonder how many brain cells its attendees are killing by the second.this crew party is the perfect opportunity.i'm trying not to get my hopes up, but it remains a possibility that i might actually get to talk to nate thornhill tonight.just the thought of his name is enough to send tingles down my spine, though i know the real-life man could probably never live up to the fantasy i've built up in my mind.i still remember the first time i saw him, walking across campus the second weekend of fall semester of freshman year.i would've bet my life then that he was a senior.compared to the boys i had just left behind in high school, he was already a full-grown man.he wore a navy blue polo like it was a second skin as he strode across the grass, jefferson's palladian architecture spread out behind him like it was built as a set for a movie he was starring in.he wore his wavy brown hair on the long side, and pushed back to keep it out of his dark blue eyes.his nose was perfectly straight and ended over a pair of soft, full lips and a chin with an actual dimple in it.if it were possible for ryan gosling and a kennedy to have a baby, the result would be nate thornhill.i later learned that he was a double major like me, and since one of mine is political science and one of his is history, we overlapped in a few of our core courses.i expected him to sit in the back with the rest of the jocks but he was always in the front row, quick to raise his hand with intelligent answers.i always hide right in the center of the halls; my shyness overwhelms me in those big lecture classes.i've never got up the courage to actually talk to him, and besides, he always has a different girl on his arm.with his looks, money, and being a star of both the lacrosse and crew teams, he draws women in like a magnet.but tonight?tonight i have promised myself that if he's at the party, i am going to introduce myself.i shoot off a quick text to cara, my new friend from class, to confirm that i'll join her tonight, and then turn to my closet.i really only have one option to wear tonight : a simple, slinky black camisole with a lace inlay that i bought at the mall in spite of miriam and allison's naysaying.i didn't know what i was buying it for then, but it's the kind of shirt i've seen other girls wearing to parties.i slip on jeans and a pair of heels that are probably a little low to be cool, but they'll have to do.it's not like i have extra money to be adding to my wardrobe.i take out the drug store makeup that i bought and sit at my desk.i never usually wear anything but chapstick, but i watched some youtube tutorials and feel confident i can mimic some of the techniques.with a compact mirror, i carefully put on a little concealer, blush, brown eye shadow, and black mascara.i bought an eyeliner, but i don't use it.i think it's a little beyond my skills.with a swipe of some sparkly lip gloss, i'm done.i close the closet door and study myself in the full-length mirror.with a start, i recognize myself in the reflection.i turn my face side to side, searching for all its imperfections.with a little makeup on, my resemblance to my mom is more pronounced.everyone always says she is beautiful, so maybe it's possible that i might be pretty, too.the shirt is more low-cut than i remembered, and i touch my breasts self-consciously.i get my large c-cups from my mom also, but i've always kept them covered up.i see how men get distracted by them, like they're some tractor beam pulling them in.one more quick glance to check my mascara application, and i nod at myself, satisfied.it's been a long time coming, but i think i'm finally ready to party.chapter two the spring night air is warm on my face as i walk across campus to meet cara and her friends.i pass other students heading out for the night and feel happy to count myself among them.i go over my rules for myself as i near the crew house, which is just across the street from campus.no more than three drinks.no talking about classes.no weirdness around nate thornhill."brynn!"cara yells from the opposite sidewalk.i wave as i head over."i can't believe you got a lawn room!that's amazing!"i lean over to give her a hug.she's an effortlessly cool, petite brunette-the kind of girl that everyone considers to be their friend."thanks!""holy shit!you got a lawn room?are you, like, a genius or something?"her friend rachel asks, her jaw dropping."i wish!then all those papers would have taken me way less time to write," i reply with a laugh."cara says you've never been to a crew party?"marie, the knockout of the group, asks."nope... just never made my way over here i guess," i reply, downplaying the situation."well, they have the best parties," she assures me."and the hottest guys.""lacrosse guys are hotter," rachel argues."of course, if you can always do both..." marie murmurs, and they burst into laughter."hey, you look great, by the way," cara says to me as we walk up the front steps of the house."love that top.""thanks," i say, trying not to glow.a couple guys chilling on the front porch greet the other girls by name, and i blush as i feel their eyes glance over me.i tug my hair self-consciously as one of them grins at me.two girls hurry past us in the opposite direction.one leans over the railing as her friend barely manages to pull her hair back before she retches into the bushes.lovely.sweat and the scent of beer greets us as we walk inside.the lights are dim, barely illuminating the mass of people crowded into the main room, and i feel my heels sticking to the sticky floor."cara, the love of my life!"a tall, brawny guy says, sweeping her up into a hug.i recognize him from the crew team.not that i've studied their roster photos or anything... "oh, ha, ha," cara says, rolling her eyes, though something about the gleam in her eyes tells me she likes the guy."can i get you ladies a beer?"he asks, nodding to the keg behind him."yes, please," cara says."hey, foster, this is my good friend brynn.this is her first crew party so treat her nice.""i'm always nice!"foster says indignantly, then bows in front of me and offers his hand."m'lady," he says, as i place my hand in his and raises it to his lips.marie and rachel giggle and then head over to another group as foster hands them their beers.cara and i follow foster over to an old, mysteriously stained, couch in the corner.we weave around other scantily clad co-eds, and for the first time in my life, i feel like one of the cool kids.i perch nervously on the far left cushion as cara sits next to me, with foster on her other side.i slowly sip my beer as he whispers in her ear.i've had beer before, even gotten tipsy a few times with allison and miriam when we first turned twenty-one and tried out some wine bars.i just want to make sure i don't overdo it tonight and end up like that girl we passed on the way inside."where's nate tonight?"my head whips around as i hear cara ask foster the question.my heart stops for a second.i have to admit i'll feel crushed if he's not even here."he's somewhere around, probably getting crushed under a pile of chicks," foster rolls his eyes, and cara laughs.i down half my beer.i can't believe how jealous it makes me feel, i've never even met the guy.cara and foster keep chatting, and though cara makes an effort to include me, i'm feeling too nervous to contribute much to the conversation.by the time i finish my beer, i really have to pee."be right back," i murmur to cara, and go looking for the bathroom.i weave through the sweaty throng to a hallway along the stairs.i see a line of five girls outside of what i assume is the bathroom, and with a sigh, i step behind the last one.the door opens and a guy darts in front of the front girl."hey!"she protests."sorry!emergency!"he cries, and shuts the door behind him.i lean back a little and glance up the stairs.there are several people hanging out on the landing, but it's definitely quieter up there, and i'm sure there's more than one bathroom in this place.holding my legs close together, i turn around and hurry up the stairs.i bypass the first couple rooms with open doors and come to a couple closed ones.i can see a room at the end of the hall that looks like a lounge, with a pool table in the middle of the room.one of these two rooms must be the bathroom.i lean toward the nearest one and press my ear against it.i can't hear anything.i knock softly and wait for a reply, and when i don't hear one, i slowly turn the knob and open the door.i gasp as it's pulled open and out of my grasp.my eyes fly up and immediately i realize that nate is standing before me."i... i..."i stammer.his pupils dilate as he stares at me in amusement.i let my gaze fall down his body.he's naked but for a pair of pale blue boxers.good lord, his body is ridiculous.the line down between his six-pack looks like it was etched in stone.it's suddenly very difficult to breathe."see anything you like?"he asks drily.i snap my gaze back up.a brown curl of hair hangs just over one of his eyes.i clear my throat as i try to think of something to say.i feel his eyes travelling over my body, my skin burning under his gaze as desire begins to pool in my stomach."oh, no, i was-" "you wan na join us?"he says, pulling the door open a little more.i glance over his shoulder and see a naked girl in bed covered in rumpled sheets."nate!"the girl says with a giggle, and pulls a sheet up over her breasts."come on.if i weren't already naked, i'd say you were undressing me with your eyes," he says smugly to me.i feel my cheeks turn scarlet."no, sorry," i murmur, averting my eyes and rushing down the hall to the stairs as i hear the girl dissolve into laughter behind me.i run straight out of the front door and down the front steps before stopping on the sidewalk to process what's just happened.ugh, i'm such an idiot.i raise my hand to my mouth and wipe the back of my palm across my lips, smearing off my lip gloss.i don't belong at parties like this, and i certainly don't belong with nate thornhill.i've never been so embarrassed in my life... and how arrogant, asking me to join him and that girl as though i actually would?hot tears build up behind my eyes and threaten to spill over.i had such high hopes for tonight, such high hopes for him.and he ended up being so gross.i pull my phone out of my wristlet and shoot off a quick text to cara : hey, just got a terrible headache.headed back to my dorm.see you later!i head back across campus and to the safety of my dorm room.my phone buzzes and i pull it back out to see her response : feel better!i envy cara.everything seems to come so easy to her.she can fit in anywhere, make friends with anyone.i guess i'm just not that kind of person, much as i'd like to be.chapter three the words are a blur on the page in front of me.i rub my eyes.i didn't sleep well last night, and now i can't concentrate on my notes.we have a few days off at the beginning of the week to study, and then final exams.i can't let myself slip just because i got a lawn room, but the events of last night are distracting me and studying right now is nearly impossible.my phone rings on the desk next to me."hey, mom!"i say as i pick up."hey, honey!i just saw you called me a bunch yesterday!i'm sorry.i was out with pierce."her melodic voice sounds a little breathless, as it always does when she talks about this new boyfriend."well, i have some good news.""me, too!"she replies."oh!um, do you want to go first?""actually, i'm going to be in town tonight.pierce and i were hoping to have dinner with you.""you're in town?!that's great news."she laughs."no, that's not the news!do you want to wait to tell me your news until then?""um, sure.why not?everything's ok, though, right?""everything's great!we have a reservation for 7 o'clock at decanter.should we pick you up?""no, that's ok.it's just a short walk from campus.""wonderful!oh, i'm so excited to see you!"she says."me too!"i shut my phone feeling dumbfounded.now i'm really not going to be able to study.my mom's never surprised me like this before.i frown.could she and pierce be engaged, and she wants to tell me in person?i guess i'd be happy for her, but i've never met this guy before.what if he's just one more jerk in the long line of lowlifes that she seems to attract?my mom is so gorgeous and always loved the attention her looks brought her, but her vanity has always worried me.men are so willing to do everything for her, but they never seem to be the right kind of men.regardless of their character, she's always had a constant stream of admirers, and has never had to do anything for herself.she doesn't know who she is or how to be alone.when i came along, my dad showed his true colors and abandoned us, and she had no skills to fall back on as a twenty-two year-old single mother.i always promised myself that i wouldn't let myself depend on a man like her.i had to make sure i could make my own way in the world, which is probably why i've had my nose in a book my whole life.after several more hours of fruitless study, i decide to get ready a little early so that i can take a walk around campus before i meet my mom and her new boyfriend.i put on a cotton summer dress and grab a cardigan in case the restaurant is chilly.i start to feel a little calmer when i reach the lawn and see the rotunda's white dome in front of me.the architecture always inspires me, and next year i'll actually be living here.i stand in front of the women's side of the lawn-genders are separated-and wonder which room will be mine.my mind drifts back unbidden to last night.i so hoped to be able to expand my horizons a little.as wonderful as i know getting a lawn room is, it's not everything.the way nate's body looked in the low light from the hall... the small tuft of hair that showed just above his boxers... the way he looked at me.i realize i'm tugging at my braid absent-mindedly, and shake my head at myself-i need to get it together.it's time to meet my mom and her new boyfriend, and hear their big news.i glance around as i enter decanter.its architecture is modern and elegant, a mix of cream fabrics and dark wood.i've never been here before-way out of my price range.i'm about to approach the hostess when i recognize my mom in a prime booth in the corner.i walk toward her between a row of tables, hearing the hushed tones of conversation and the clinking of wine glasses around me.her eyes light up and she stands as she sees me approaching.she looks even more gorgeous than usual.her blonde hair, a little lighter than mine, hangs in a long bob almost to her shoulders, and her perfect teeth show brightly behind her deep red lipstick."brynn!i've missed you, honey," she says, enveloping me in a hug."you look gorgeous.isn't this dress a little big for you, though?"she asks, pulling at the extra fabric."you know i like this kind of fit," i reply, allowing only the slightest bit of impatience to enter my voice.this is a recurring conversation with us.she always wants me to dress a little more feminine, a little more "form-flattering" as she puts it."well, i'm so excited for you to meet pierce.he's just in the restroom-oh!here he is."i follow her gaze to an elegantly dressed man with salt-and-pepper hair and blue eyes who's approaching us with a warm smile."holly, i'd think this was your sister if i didn't know any better," he says, and my mom giggles."brynn, i'm pierce.your mom has told me such wonderful things about you," he says as we shake hands."likewise," i reply politely, though the truth is that she's told me almost nothing."well, let's sit.i ordered us some champagne for the table.it should be arriving soon."we all obediently sit, me on one side of the cushy leather booth, and my mom and pierce on the other."so, brynn, you're in your junior year?""yes, that's-" i break off as my mom reaches for her water glass and i spot a ring on her left hand.not an engagement ring, either.a wedding ring."what's that?"i ask sharply."oh," my mom flutters."well, we were going to wait until my son arrived, but-" "we're married!"my mom announces suddenly.my jaw drops open."married?"i squeak."i mean, i thought maybe you'd be engaged but married?""you're upset?"my mom asks worriedly."no, not upset..." i struggle to put my emotions into the right words.i always feel the need to protect my mom from what i'm really feeling.she's always been more fragile than me."just surprised, that's all.i mean, how long have you known each other?""well, we met six months ago," my mom says."and then pierce took me on a surprise trip to the turks and caicos last week, and everything was just so perfect..." she trails off, looking to him for support."it really was, brynn.and it felt so right.we wished you guys could have been there, but we just felt that we had to seize the moment.it was in this little gazebo on the cliff, with spectacular views of the water, and the captain of a boat that was docked at the resort officiated..." "it was engagement, honeymoon, and wedding in one!we just wished you and nate could have been there.that would have made it even more perfect."i struggle to catch up with all the information they're throwing at me."sorry, who's nate?""oh, nate's my son.he goes to school here, too.i tried to get a hold of him so we could tell you together, but-wait!there he is!"pierce slides out of the booth to wave to his son.nate.not nate... "what's pierce's last name?"i whisper urgently to my mom."thornhill," she whispers back distractedly, sliding over to stand next to pierce.oh my god.nate thornhill is here.nate thornhill is currently walking up behind me.nate thornhill is my new... stepbrother, i realize in horror.beads of sweat form at my hairline and i've suddenly lost my appetite.chapter four as nate walks into my periphery, i watch in slow motion as he hugs his dad and shakes hands with my mom.i can not believe this is happening.surely i'm in the middle of some strange nightmare and will wake up soon.i hoped i'd never have to see him again after last night."brynn, honey, this is nate, pierce's son," my mom says, cutting through the fog of emotion in my brain."h-hi.nate.brynn.i'm brynn," i stammer as he glances over at me."brynn, pleasure to meet you," he replies formally.wait, does he not even remember meeting me last night?"well, scooch over brynn, so nate can sit," mom says, waving me over with her hands."right, sorry," i say, sliding over so that he can sit next to me.i stare straight ahead as he sits.i can feel my body betraying me already.the heat from his leg under the table is giving me heart palpitations."thought you weren't going to be able to make it," pierce says a little tensely to his son."sorry, i was in the library studying.i had my phone off.""well, you missed the big announcement.we were just telling brynn that holly and i have gotten married."i glance at nate out of the corner of my eye.i see his eyes widen in surprise."married?i thought you said you'd never get married again.""well, things change.when i met holly, i just knew.you'll see when you get to know her.she's a special woman."i watch my mom glow like a 1000 watt bulb and can't help but smile.it's been a while since i've seen her so happy."yeah, i'm... i'm just..." i watch him struggle for words just like i did."surprised.but happy.i'm looking forward to getting to know you better, holly."wow, that was... kind.not what the guy i met last night would say."oh, me too, nate," my mom replies, looking overjoyed."and i'm so excited for you and brynn to get to know each other!""two only children..." pierce says meaningfully."you'll have to learn to share."my mom laughs and i join in weakly."you always wanted a sibling, brynn!and now you have one!well, a step-sibling, but still."a step-sibling that i've had literally dozens of dirty dreams about.perfect."so, you two have never met, then?"my mom asks, glancing between us."pierce and i were so excited when we realized both our kids were juniors here.""uva is my alma mater," pierce adds proudly."no, we've never met," i break in quickly.i see nate eye me for a second before he nods."nope, never met, unfortunately," he says."we thought it best not to tell you guys about us until we knew it would really be forever.i thought it would have just been so awkward for you two if we'd broken up and then you have to keep seeing each other around campus," my mom explains."yes, that would have been awkward," nate says drily, and i know he's thinking that nothing could compare to my own awkwardness last night.the waitress comes over with the bottle of champagne that pierce ordered.dom perignon, i see as i look at the label.whoa, he must be loaded.my new stepdad must be loaded.she expertly pops the cork and pours us each an elegant flute, placing the bottle into a wine cooler next to the table.pierce takes his glass and raises it."to a new family," he says, looking around the table.we all raise our glasses and clink them together.i manage to do so without making eye contact with nate.the champagne tickles my throat on the way down.i've never wanted to drink a bottle of alcohol more in my entire life than at this moment, but i keep myself to a modest sip."so, honey, you told me you had some news, too?"my mom asks, as she puts down her glass."oh, yes, though i don't think i can follow that announcement," i hedge with a smile."please!you sounded excited on the phone," she encourages me."well, i got a lawn room," i reveal.my mom gasps in excitement, but i see pierce glance quickly at his son."i thought you said that they hadn't announced it yet," he says quietly."i... i knew you'd be disappointed.i was waitlisted.it was difficult, juggling two varsity sports, a double major-" nate replies.i glance at my mom and then between the two men.nate is looking down at the tablecloth."i was selected for a lawn room, too," pierce says, interrupting him and turning to me."it's an important accomplishment.""thank you..." i say hesitantly.nate looks so miserable."being waitlisted is impressive, too."he glances up at me sharply, his eyes flashing.shit.i heard it, too : pity."well, congratulations, both of you," my mom breaks in."i have no idea what i'm going to order!everything looks so wonderful."she runs her finger down the menu in front of her.having grown up in a family of irish immigrants, my mom has always avoided conflict like the plague, though this time i'm glad for the change of subject.i decide to order the steak since money doesn't seem to be an issue, and we each order a cocktail in addition to the champagne.something begins to tug at the back of my brain after the waitress leaves to put in our food orders."pierce, i'm sorry if this is an ignorant question, but were you in office?your name sounds so familiar.""yes," he replies, looking pleased."i'm a former congressman-" "-for virginia.now i remember.you helped pass the campaign finance reforms."i smile."good memory.""one of my majors is political science, so i try to keep up with it.""and your other major?""global health.""you know, i run thornhill and co.consulting of k street, and we're still looking for a summer intern.interested?""dad, i thought you were going-" nate breaks in before i can respond."and i thought you were going to get a lawn room," his dad replies, keeping his voice light."so, brynn, what do you think?""well, um, i was just going to get a summer job back in maryland to help pay for tuition," i murmur.did pierce promise his son the internship?i don't want to start off this relationship with nate on the wrong foot."you don't need to worry about tuition now, honey," my mom says softly.i look at her in surprise.oh my god-is pierce going to pay for my college bills?the thought hadn't even occurred to me.i look between them as they stare back at me calmly."oh, oh, i didn't think-i mean, i'd love to, but i just-if nate wants the-" "then it's settled," pierce cuts in."i tend to go into the office quite early, but we have an extra car you can use.""sorry?i don't understand.""well, pierce and i are moving in together.i mean, i basically live there now, but i'm officially selling the old house, now that we're married.""right.of course."my brain scrambles to process all the new information.just as i'm working it all out, i feel a hand on my knee.i look down in surprise to see nate's arm disappearing under the tablecloth.i glance at him.he's looking straight ahead as though nothing's happening.i struggle to maintain my composure as heat travels from his hand and all the way up to... "so, this summer, i'll be living with you then?all of you?"nate turns to smile at me politely.his hand moves another inch up the bare skin of my thigh.i widen my eyes at him but he doesn't react."that's right.we'll all be living at pierce's house-" "our house," pierce corrects my mom with a smile."our house, in potomac.it's got tons of space, beautiful views of the river.it'll be wonderful to have the summer to bond with each other, and really become a family."nate's hand moves another inch up my leg.i can feel the rough, calloused skin of his palm.i've never been so turned on in my life, but i'm struggling against it.what is he thinking?we're at dinner with our parents!"i know you have some stuff at the old house, but we'll have it moved to the new one.everything will be all set up when you get home," my mom says, smiling at me."mmm," i reply, trying to focus on her words."i wasn't that attached to the old place anyway," i add with a shrug.we'd moved a couple times after my dad left, so no one place has ever felt like home.nate's hand moves another inch up my thigh, pushing up the hem of my dress so his fingers rest under it.my whole body is tingling.holy hell, i can barely breathe.i'm shocked pierce and my mom don't seem to notice that anything's happening.with his other hand, nate takes a calm sip from his champagne flute.where's the waitress?he'll have to move his hand when the food comes.he moves his hand up another inch.i can't take it any longer-another second and i'm going to start moaning.as my mom moves her head to pierce's ear to murmur sweet nothings, i slide my fork off the table and press it tongs-first into the top of nate's hand.i hear him make a sharp intake of breath and then his mouth twitches as he tries to hold position through the pain.i press down harder.suddenly he yanks his hand away and i just manage to stop my hand in time so the fork doesn't hit my leg.he turns to me and smiles, a wicked glimmer in his eyes.he was fucking with me, i realize.that's his way of taking revenge for me showing him up in front of his dad?what a goddamn creep!i lean toward him with a fake smile plastered on my face."if you're that pissed about it, bring it up with your dad, don't take it out on me.i did try to turn it down."i hiss into his ear.he turns to me with an equally fake smile."i'll do whatever the hell i like, sis."he says quietly so our parents can't hear.the rest of the meal passes without nate making another fake pass at me.the gears in my brain begin to move as i think about how i'm going to be spending the entire summer, and potentially many other seasons, living with this guy.my life has been completely upended tonight, and i need some time to process everything.after the waitress clears our coffee cups and pierce takes care of the bill with a black amex card, we stand up to say goodbye.they're going to drive back to maryland tonight since it takes under three hours.i hug pierce goodbye, then my mom."i know this was a lot to take in, honey.we'll talk everything over, i promise," she whispers reassuringly, then kisses me on the cheek.i smile at her and begin to tear up-i'm pretty overwhelmed.nate surprises me by leaning in for a hug as our parents look on with a smile."great to meet you," he says, then whispers almost silently in my ear, "sorry, we'll never get a chance to have that threesome, sis."i freeze as he pats my back once and then breaks away.he remembered.and now he will always know how attracted i am to him.i have a feeling i'm never going to hear the end of it.chapter five "i don't mean to question the relationship, it was just so sudden," i explain to my mom as she drives me home from the airport.i usually never fly to or from college, but pierce insisted.my biggest worry was that nate and i might be on the same flight, but luckily his exams ended earlier than mine.i want as much time as possible to prepare myself for our interactions."no, i get it, i really do," my mom assures me."you can ask me anything about pierce, or me and pierce, and i won't be upset.""he treats you well?""he's wonderful.he's always surprising me with little gifts, trips, even.i don't know what i've done to deserve him.""well, i think you're pretty great."i offer dramatically."oh, i didn't mean it like that!i just mean, pierce treats me like a princess.and the house is basically a castle," she adds, pointing to her right.i gasp at the flagstone mansion we're pulling alongside."shut up.that's his house!?it's huge!""i know, right?"my mom replies with a laugh."it has maid's quarters!but you'll get used to it, really.""there's a maid?""he used to have a housekeeper/maid who would cook for him, but now i do most of that stuff.i love having someone else to cook for again.the maid just comes once a week now to do a really thorough cleaning," she explains as we pull through the wrought-iron gates leading the driveway."are you still working at the salon?"she used to support herself as a manicurist at the tiny salon back in our small town in eastern maryland."nope, not anymore.i'm volunteering, though, and thinking of joining some charitable boards," she says nonchalantly.my mom, a lady who lunches, i think, shaking my head.i don't know if i can see it.my mom presses a button on the car's dashboard and one of the two garage doors opens.we pull inside and i look around at the huge space as the door closes behind us.if i'm this in shock about the size of the garage, i can't imagine how i'll feel about the rest of the place.after the tour, which took over an hour because the house is so massive, my mom finally leads me to my room.my head is swimming at the lavishness of my new home.as we walk down the plushly carpeted hallway, i'm alarmed to realize that i can actually smell nate.he must be nearby somewhere.i've been dreading seeing him again and hoped i'd have more time to settle in before our first confrontation."here's nate's room," my mom says as we pass a partially open door."he's out somewhere right now."i shake my head at myself.i wish i could turn off the part of my body that's attracted to him.if anything, though, my sex dreams about him have only become more frequent and more alarming ever since he laid his hand on my thigh."and here's your room."i can't believe it's right next door to nate's room.there are so many rooms in this place-i would have preferred to have a bit more separation between us."whoa," i say as she pushes the door open, and my misgivings about the room are forgotten.a canopy with a delicate white fabric settled on it hangs over the four-poster bed in the center of the room.a matching nightstand, bureau, and vanity make up the rest of the furniture.the wallpaper is a tasteful, blue and white pattern with small birds on it that complements the light, airy feel of the room.i release the handle of my luggage and head over the to the window seat and kneel on it.there's a spectacular view of the potomac river below-the house was clearly built to play up the amazing location.i glance to my left."is that my own bathroom?""yup-no more sharing!"my mom replies gaily.i step inside and admire the all-white tile and huge tub.i've never been in a house so nice.i can't believe i'm actually going to call this place home from now on."you want anything to eat?"my mom asks from the bedroom."um, yeah, that would be great," i call over my shoulder."ok, i'll whip something up.you stay here and get settled.i'll be in the kitchen when you're ready to eat."i wander back into the bedroom as my mom disappears down the stairs.there is one question i have that i can't bring myself to ask her.it's just... i know my mom worries about money, about me graduating from school with so much debt.it's not that i think she would have married pierce just for the money, but i worry that it might have clouded her judgment a bit.they got married so quickly-can she really know him that well?maybe i'm just falling back into my usual pattern of co-dependency and mothering her.she's a grown woman, i can't control what she does and i'm not responsible for her decisions... not to mention, i am hugely relieved to not have to carry around student loans for the rest of my life.i kick my sandals off and sink back down onto the window seat.the potomac is a dark green sliver barely visible through the bushy trees that line the back of the estate and continue down to the shoreline.i startle as a figure breaks the stillness.i recognize nate's head as he walks up from the lower lawn to the pool, a lacrosse stick tucked over his shoulder.sheesh-is he training already?school just ended!i bite my lip as i watch him toss the stick on the deck and peel off his shirt.he uses it to wipe the sweat off his face, then tosses it on a chair and kicks off his sneakers.his body is just... impossible.i mean, i guess it makes sense.two varsity sports are probably enough to give anyone a body like a greek god, but he also has the face to match.he jumps in the pool and i watch him swim a lap, the cool blue water cascading over his muscular back and shoulders.i need to get used to seeing him like this-and stop acting like a total freak every time we're in the same room.this is my new normal."your food's ready!"my mom calls upstairs, her voice echoing a bit in the multi-level foyer.i jump up and head downstairs.i turn into a formal dining room before finding my way to the kitchen.i stop as i realize the kitchen windows look directly out onto the pool.great."i can't believe nate's already in the pool.the water's still freezing," my mom comments."yeah, he's crazy..." i reply, before i really hear what she said.i'm too distracted by nate's backstroke, his arms cutting cleanly through the water."so you two never once ran into each other on campus in the three years you've been at uva?"she asks, sliding a blt onto the glass table in the breakfast nook.we sit down across from each other and i start eating."no, well... we hadn't ever met.""but?"my mom digs, hearing a slight hesitation in my voice."well, nate's really well known around campus.he starts on the lacrosse and crew teams, he's smart, good-" i catch myself and pretend to clear my throat."good-looking?"my mom asks with a smile."mom..." i groan."well, he is.i'm not blind.actually, pierce looked just like him when he was his age."i see nate get out of the pool over my mom's shoulder and shake himself off.i force myself to look down at my sandwich as he walks across to a lawn chair and lies down."what happened to nate's mom?"my mom winces."pierce doesn't really like to talk about it-too painful.apparently, she cheated on him and then abandoned him and nate.they never see her.""oh, that's awful," i murmur, trying to shove down the twinge of pity i feel for my new stepbrother."i think it's one of the things that brought us together-raising a child by ourselves."my eyes flick to the door as nate slides it open.he's put his shirt back on but it clings to his still damp torso, emphasizing his muscular pecs and shoulders.he drops his sneakers on the mat as he shuts the door behind him."hey nate," my mom greets him."would you like a sandwich?""you don't have to do that," he says, a little gruffly."i don't mind at all," she replies, standing to move back to the counter.he pauses, then sits in her abandoned chair a bit reluctantly."it's so funny that you and brynn never met at school!""i think there might have been one time-" he says, glancing at me, that same devilish look back in his eyes.i feel his knee come to rest against mine under the table, and i quickly cross my legs."in class.we have been in a few of the same classes together," i clarify, narrowing my eyes at him."we have?"he asks looking genuinely surprised.my mom quietly spreads mayo on a slice of bread at the marble island."yes," i whisper, embarrassed.of course he wouldn't remember all of the times we've sat in the same classroom-only the time when i ogled him in the doorway of his bedroom and completely embarrassed myself.i blush.i want to sink into this seat cushion and disappear.he frowns at me then turns his palm over and begins to pick at a callous."so honey, pierce says you'll start your internship on monday, ok?that'll give you a few days to settle in," my mom says as she slides the sandwich in front of nate."sounds good," i reply, glancing at nate out of the corner of my eye."i'm having someone over for dinner tomorrow night," he announces rather abruptly."oh, wonderful.a friend from around here?""not a friend, really.a girl i dated in high school," nate clarifies.i keep my eyes trained carefully forward."do you know if she has any dietary restrictions?"my mom asks, excitedly flying into hostess mode."i could make this chicken dish my mom passed down, or..." i tune out as she offers more ideas, and polish off my sandwich as quickly as possible so i can excuse myself and go upstairs.i sigh as i close my bedroom door behind me.so now i have to have dinner with nate's ex-girlfriend.is this what the rest of the summer is going to be like?nate punishing me for his father's favor by exploiting my attraction to him?i'd rather be back in the library, buried in a book.chapter six i push the sauteed chicken around my plate as i try not to watch nate drape his arm around the back of dana's chair.she's pretty.very pretty.and sweet.i wish she weren't so sweet so i could hate her for a good reason."so how long did you two date?"my mom asks."well, it was on and off, so... hard to say.he actually went to prom with one of my friends," she replies, jokingly nudging nate, who at least has the grace to blush."nate..." his dad says, shaking his head admonishingly."oh, it's ok.i went with one of his friends," dana says with a smile."i think we both knew it wasn't meant to be.""a couple of my friends met their husbands in high school," my mom says, resting her fork on her plate."though i read an article recently that said that twenty-eight percent of women meet their husbands in college."she looks pointedly at me and i jump up."i'll clear," i announce.i have a feeling i know where this conversation is headed and i want to avoid it."oh, thank you, brynn," pierce says, as i stack the plates on top of one another."no problem," i reply."i waited tables in high school.""same," nate says, as i reach in front of him to take his plate."you did not," i retort, before i can think.he looks up at me and raises his eyebrows, his gaze unreadable beneath them.pierce laughs."it's true.""my dad says working is the only way to build character," nate reports quietly."oh," i say, blushing as i push my way through the swinging door into the kitchen.i place the china carefully next to the sink and lean onto the counter.god, i feel like i can't say anything right around nate.my mind freezes up while my body is set on fire."so, are you dating anyone at school, brynn?"pierce asks.damn him."not right now," i reply, sitting back down."who were you dating?maybe i know him," nate says, his dark eyes picking up the candlelight in the table's elaborate centerpiece.my mom spent all afternoon on it."probably not," i say evasively, pasting a polite smile on my face.he really knows how to get under my skin.the truth is, i've never really dated anyone, much as my mom pushes me, and as much as i'm embarrassed by the fact."who wants dessert?"i manage to sidestep any more questioning by bringing out the last course, though now i'm starting to think about the fact that nate and dana are probably going to want to go off somewhere after this and have sex.i hope it's not in nate's room.what if i can hear them through the wall?my mom insists on clearing the dessert plates, and nate and dana stand up.pierce and nate start talking quietly, and dana comes over to me."you are so gorgeous."she offers."i have to ask : what do you use on your skin?""i-what?um, soap?"oh man, she really makes it difficult to hate her."soap?just... soap?oh my god, i have this whole routine," she says, laughing at herself."well, thanks.i guess i'll be seeing you around often?"i ask, but she looks surprised."because you and nate are dating.""we're not really dating," she confides to me."he's not the type, and i gave up hope years ago.but just look at him-can you blame me for coming back?"she says with a grin, then her eyes widen."oh my gosh-sorry!i forgot for a second that he's your brother!""step-brother," i correct her."well, i'm gon na head upstairs.it was really nice to meet you, dana.""you, too," she replies, stepping away to join pierce and nate's conversation.i head into the foyer but at the last second decide not to go upstairs.i need some air.i find myself heading down the hallway and to the french doors in the wood-paneled study.they open onto the patio and i step outside with relief, closing the door behind me.the firm breeze from the river calls me forward and i head down toward it.i circle around the swimming pool on the first level of the backyard, and then down to a grassy lawn with a lacrosse goal set up on one end.the wooden stairs down to the rocky beach are set on the right side, and it takes me a minute to find them in the dark.as i head down the steps, i see the potomac spread out in front of me.the water rushes hungrily by, lit only by the sparsely set houses on the cliffs surrounding it.as i step onto the shore, i can feel the rocks pressing up through my sandals, and boulders casting long, dark shadows on either side of me.this is no white-sand beach.the river runs dangerously fast after rains, and there are even white-water rapids along parts of it.i look back at the steps behind me and then back out at the river.i feel so out of place here.even though our old house didn't really feel like home either, i wish i were there now, stretched out on the ratty old couch, with my mom in her chair, watching something on our small tv.i don't know if i'll ever be able to feel like i belong here.i'll always feel like a guest in pierce's house.i walk down closer to the water until i can feel the pebbles getting smaller underneath my feet.i don't want my shoes to get wet.i jump as a bird breaks out of a tree above me.i can just see it as it flies off, its body a moving ink blot against the dark sky.i wish i could follow it.i turn and walk back toward the steps, feeling as lonely as i've ever felt.i shake my head at myself as i climb the wooden stairs.my mom is happy, and i'm fortunate to live in a place like this.stop feeling sorry for yourself, brynn.as i walk across the lower lawn, i look up and see my mom and pierce's bedroom light go off.i guess they're turning in early tonight.i walk up toward the pool and freeze as i hear a moan.the lights downstairs are all off except one in the hall, and the pool's lights underneath the water.my eyes dart around and fall on two writhing bodies on a poolside lounge chair.nate and dana.i stare as nate whips off his own shirt and then dana's.i know i should move but i don't.the blue pool lights shimmer against his back muscles as he expertly undoes dana's bra and pulls off her pants and underwear.leave, you pervert!my brain commands me, but my body stays firmly glued in place, even as it throbs with desire.one of nate's hands massages dana's ample breasts, and the other disappears beneath her.dana cries out immediately and i almost gasp myself, as though his hands are moving against me.i can practically feel his touch on me, his hot breath against my ear as his expert fingers move inside me... nate grunts and pushes against her.she struggles to contain herself as he thrusts slowly in and out of her.oh my god-what am i doing!?i step back with a jolt as though i'm breaking out of a trance and almost trip over the hydrangea bush next to me in my hurry to get away.i run as quickly and quietly as i can around the side of the house and to the front.i reach the front door and pray that nate is going to lock up later.i feel the doorknob turn and push the door open in relief.i hurry up the curving staircase and down the hall into my room, kicking off my sandals before hurling myself onto my bed and burying my head in the pillows.i can feel my cheeks burning with mortification over what i just witnessed and the uncontrollable desire i felt.i've had crushes before, but none like my obsession with nate.and even after finally meeting him, only to have him tease me and push my buttons, i still feel so physically drawn to him.i pull my face out of the pillow and crawl to the nightstand, pulling my dog-eared copy of lady chatterley's lover out of the top drawer.just as i'm opening it to the folded-over page, there's a quiet knock at my door.i toss my book on the bed and walk to it, hoping and praying it's not nate.i almost jump as i pull open the door and nate's face appears, shrouded in the darkness of the hallway.he leans forward, leaning his forearm on the doorjamb as i step back nervously.his wavy hair looks particularly unruly, and his lips are curved in a slight smile."technically speaking, does a peeping tom have to be outside, looking inside?or does the term still apply if both, or all three, parties are outdoors?"he asks, calmly, tilting his chin up slightly as he considers me."i... i don't..." i stammer, feeling heat crawl up the back of my neck."you.were.watching us," he accuses me, narrowing his eyes."i'm sorry.i didn't mean to.i just... i was down at the river... how did you...?""i heard a twig snap and saw you running away like a drunken ostrich.""did dana-?""no, and i didn't tell her.""thank god.""so?what did you think?"he smirks."oh, i'm so sorry, again.i'm so embarrassed," i rush on.it strikes me that this is the longest conversation i've ever had with my new stepbrother.and it's about how i'm a pervert.fantastic."why were you watching us?"he asks, stepping forward into my room.i take another step away from him."um, i... i don't know.it just sort of happened.i didn't mean to.""liar," he comments lightly."asshole."it slips out before i can stop myself.he tilts his head slightly."prude," he levels at me.i look down.maybe i am a prude, but i don't want to be."what's that?"he asks.when i look back up at him, i see him gazing past me, to my book on the bed."nothing, just a book," i say, but he's breezing past me toward it.i hurry after him but he reaches the bed before me and picks up the book."see?"i say defiantly."i know what lady chatterley's lover is about," he says, looking at me with a smug grin.shit."maybe not such a prude after all," he adds, running his eyes up and down my body.i swallow hard."you know what i think?"he asks, stepping toward me.i step away again, feeling one of the posts of my bed against my back."i think you want me.i think you can barely contain yourself.""that's mighty arrogant of you," i comment.i begin to tug the ends of my hair nervously."why are you doing that?"he asks, frowning."it's just a nervous habit," i say with a shrug, and drop my hand."so i make you nervous?""no," i reply quickly."just you being in here..." "i'm only arrogant if i'm wrong.""wrong about what?"i feel the urge to pull my hair again but don't want to give him the satisfaction."wrong about you wanting me.let's give it a test-" he narrows his eyebrows, studying me."i'm going to kiss you now, and all you have to do is tell me to stop.""what?that's crazy.not to mention you just fucked dana, and now you expect me to kiss you?"i protest, but he steps toward me.i try to pull backward but i'm already pressed against my bedpost.desire unfurls deep in my stomach as his eyes lock onto mine."if it's crazy, just tell me to stop," he whispers teasingly, and moves closer.his musky scent fills my nose and my mind begins to swim.i feel wetness trickling down my thigh as he curls his arms around me, grasping the bedpost with both hands behind my lower back.he's so close to me.i can feel heat radiating off him.his legs and chest sink against me and he moves his lips toward mine.just a few inches between nate thornhill's mouth and mine.now an inch.now two centimeters... I can feel his warm breath against my partially open lips..."stop."i whisper.he freezes but doesn't pull away, as though he can't believe what he's just heard.though truthfully, i'm marveling at my own restraint.i can feel his erection against my thigh-i know he wants me, too.now i can beat him at his own game.i lean forward slightly, allowing my lips to brush against his as i speak, "unless you don't want to."his eyes, which were focused on my lips, flick back up to meet mine.i force myself to stay steady even as i'm consumed by the lust in his gaze.he stares at me for a moment, then pushes off the bedpost and steps back.he opens his mouth, about to say something, but nothing comes out.i remain pressed against the bedpost as he turns and moves toward the door.without looking back, he shuts it behind him.i stumble forward and take a deep breath.it's like he takes all the air out of the room and i can't breathe when he's around.i can't believe i just rejected him.i'm stunned, but i also feel like giving myself a standing ovation.i just resisted the advances of nate thornhill, my fantasy of almost three years.i should win a willpower award.i knew that if i'd let him kiss me, i would forever lose any kind of power in our relationship.i'd be just be another pathetic girl who fell for his charms.of course, the downside is that i'm more turned on than i've ever been in my life, and i'm alone with a book again.i sigh and crawl back onto my bed.i have a feeling that whatever is happening between me and my stepbrother, i haven't seen the end of it yet.chapter seven "i'm so happy there's another girl working here!"constance says, swiveling around on her desk chair.she's my new cubicle mate, and one of only a handful of other interns at thornhill and co. "ah, there.my outlook is finally working," i announce, opening the email system on my desktop."so they'll want you to sign an nda and stuff, but after, want to go to lunch?"she asks."what's an nda?"i turn to face her."non-disclosure agreement.there are a ton of senators and big business types who come in here, and you can't tell anyone.very important," she says in hushed tones.she seems very pleased that she's snagged this coveted internship, which is probably why i haven't told her that i'm the boss's stepdaughter.i've never benefited from nepotism before, and it feels strange and uncomfortable to me now."oh.well i'd love to get lunch later this week, but i'm having lunch with my friend allison today.we go to uva together, and she's got an internship at this urban planning place in georgetown, so i'm going to meet up with her.""cool.georgetown has really good shopping.i'd love to go with you sometime.fashion is like, my side hobby, and you have a stylist's dream body.""i don't think i-" i begin my canned response to a shopping invitation before i realize that maybe i can afford it.and constance looks so perfectly chic in her patterned cardigan and statement necklace."you know, that would be wonderful.i really don't know what to buy.""oh, i can help you with that.but careful not to wear anything too tight around mr. Thornhill," she adds, rolling her eyes."what do you mean?"i ask with a frown."oh my god, who is that?"constance asks, breaking away from our conversation to stand and peer over our cubicle wall.i join her to see nate and pierce walking down the hallway together toward the elevator bank.they must be having lunch together."that's his son," i reply, immediately sitting down again."he looks like a polo model!"constance exclaims, sitting back down."um, what were you saying about pierce-mr. thornhill-just then?""well, i've never had an issue, but maybe he's just not into asian girls," she says, throwing her black hair over her shoulder carelessly."from what i've heard, though, he has a certain reputation.""oh, no," i reply, worriedly tugging on my hair.shit.shit.i knew he was too good to be true."don't worry.from what i've heard, he's pretty harmless, he's just from a different generation when it comes to women around the office-especially young women," she adds."mmhm," i reply, my mind already spiraling into crisis mode."you ok, brynn?""maybe he's changed, though.i mean, he's married now," i say, clinging to a speck of hope."yeah, i heard he got married."she shrugs."could be.i don't think it's something that's been really recent or anything."i nod, feeling slightly mollified.we both spin back to our computers as we hear footsteps approaching our cubicle.i glance up to see pierce and nate appear in the opening."brynn, this is going to sound awful," pierce begins, and i brace myself."but nate and i had plans to go to lunch, and we got down to the lobby before i realized how rude it was not to invite you along."phew.for a second i thought he overheard our conversation."oh, that's so nice, but i actually have lunch plans with my best friend from school, anyway.""oh i see... Well, enjoy!there are some great restaurants around here.we just wanted to let you know you were invited," pierce says kindly, though from nate's frown i'm guessing that it was more his idea than his son's."constance, right?"he says, turning to her."yes, that's right," she squeaks."alright, well, we better get going or we'll be late for our reservation.see you at home!"pierce says with a wave, and walks off with nate in tow.huh.i notice that nate didn't say a single word to me.i guess he doesn't like being the one left wanting for once."why will mr. Thornhill see you at home?"constance says, slowly turning her desk chair to face me, a weird expression on her face."um, well, i'm his stepdaughter.he just married my mom."constance gasps and buries her face in her hands."oh my god, oh my god, i'm so fired.i'm fired, right?""what?no!i don't have that kind of authority, i'm just an intern, like you.""you're the boss's daughter, and i was just gossiping about him!""step-daughter, and i get it.if i'd heard rumors like that, i might want to warn other women i work with, too.""but i don't even know if they're true, i'm so sorry," she says miserably."really, it's ok. and i'm sorry that i didn't tell you earlier that i'm his stepdaughter.i just... you know, didn't want it to seem like it was the only reason i got the internship.i mean, i really do work very hard.""of course you do!of course.yes.i should get back to work," constance says, turning to her computer and beginning to type rapidly."... and now i'm worried she's going to keep acting really weird around me," i confide to allison over a caesar salad at clyde's on m street."do you think it's true?"she whispers, leaning over the table between us."i don't know... i mean, maybe he was just a flirt, and it got blown out of proportion, you know?""i bet that's what it is," allison says, nodding her head sagely."who knows how stories like that really get started?and once they're out there, you can't erase them.""i hope that's what it is... i don't want to discount some woman's, or women's, experience just because it would be inconvenient for me, though, and painful for my mom.she would be so crushed if it were true.""i wouldn't worry about it.and that girl said they were old stories, right?""right.""and you said he treats your mom well, so i bet they're just ugly rumors.""yeah, yeah," i reply, pushing the thought of pierce's alleged misbehavior to the back of my brain."how's the place you're staying at george washington?"i ask, knowing she's taking advantage of a program at the nearby university to give summer interns a low-cost place to stay in an otherwise expensive city."it's fine.my roommate's kinda loud, though.how's your new house?""it's so big!i don't know why anyone would need that much space.i mean before my mom and i got there, it was just for two people.well, three, including the maid.""there's a maid?!""there was.she doesn't live there anymore.oh, and there's all this flagstone on it, so i thought it was old, but my mom said that pierce had the house built around fifteen years ago.he must have spent a lot of money to make something so new look worn-in.""you're lucky," allison says."i know.""how's the stepbrother?i don't know if i could live with a dumb jock.""well, nate's not dumb.i've been in a few classes with him, and he's really smart.he was even waitlisted for a lawn room.""you're a little defensive of him," allison observes, sipping her water."yeah, i guess so.i don't know why though.he's been playing these weird mind games with me.""mind games?"she repeats, frowning.i push a crouton around my plate as i think about how much to tell her.i have a feeling it's not the kind of situation she'd condone, but i also really want to talk to someone about what's been going on."well, you remember that i used to have a crush on him?""yeah, i remember you saying something about it sophomore year.""i... i still have a crush on him.or i think i do... i don't know.i'm definitely attracted to him, and he's aware of the fact.he can be really rude, and then last night, he almost kissed me, but he..." "whoa, what?i mean, brynn, he's your stepbrother.""i know!but only for the last few weeks, and-" "ok... but what if you did kiss?what then?you'd have to see him every day, because your mom and his dad are married.and then even if you weren't living together, what about holidays?you'd be cutting the thanksgiving turkey and sitting across from the guy you'd made out with... for every thanksgiving.""ugh, you're right," i reply, dropping my fork and covering my face with my hands.this is why i didn't want to tell allison-she'd throw logic in the face of my hormones.but the truth is, she's right.i feel like a bucket of cold water has just been poured over my head."you're right," i repeat."i can't believe i even let it get this far."i head back to the office after lunch and spend the rest of the afternoon sitting in an awkward silence with constance.i try to get her to engage about online shopping, but she only offers me one-word responses.later in the day i meet another intern named greg, a cute, strawberry-blonde guy who blushes when i look him in the eye.he is more the kind of person i should be looking to date.i just wish i felt that same rush that i do whenever i'm around nate.i drive home just after six in the old audi that was just sitting in the thornhill's garage.it's definitely the most expensive car i've ever driven, and it's fun to really let out the engine on the short stretch of the beltway on my way back to potomac.i park in the garage and let myself in to the small anteroom off the kitchen, where i kick off my shoes."mom?"i call out, before spotting her outside on the back lawn, talking on the phone as the sun sets behind her.i head upstairs with my tote bag still over my shoulder.the huge house is silent as i walk up the steps and down the hallway.nate must still be at his internship.my mom told me he got one at some think tank downtown.i drop my bag as i walk into my bedroom and push the door almost closed behind me with my foot.i can't wait to get this skirt off.it's my one pencil skirt, and it's a little itchy around my waist.i step into the bathroom and turn on the elegant faucet in the sink.i tie my hair behind my head with a loose elastic and splash some cool water on my skin.first days are always exhausting, but i think today was unusually so.as i look back up to my reflection, dripping with water, i see something move in the mirror.i stare at it blankly, not understanding what i'm seeing.the mirror above the sink is reflecting the mirror above my vanity in the bedroom, which is in turn reflecting an image from my partially open bedroom door.it's nate, i realize.he's standing outside my door, and he doesn't realize i can see him.i look down at the sink, pretending to watch the last of the water as it swirls down the drain.a shiver of excitement runs through me at the idea that nate could actually be interested in me-i mean, he's there, right now, watching me.before i process what i'm doing, before i can think of all the reasons not to, i slowly move my hands to my lower back and undo the clasp at the top of the zipper, then unzip my skirt.i let it fall in a pile at my feet, then step out of it.i look up carefully and nate is still there in the double reflection.allison's warning echoes through my mind but i keep going.i feel high, high on the feeling that i'm actually desired.i catch hold of the back of my rather shapeless blouse in my hands and pull it up over my head, then toss it onto the floor.as i look back in the mirror, i try to imagine what someone else might see when they look at me, without my constant negative interior monologue telling me nasty things about myself.do i have the kind of body that someone like nate could find attractive?now down to my bra and underwear, i begin to feel nervous, but i reach up to unclasp my bra.i feel the straps loosen on my shoulders and bring my hands forward to catch it as it falls."brynn?you home?"i hear my mom call from the foyer.i freeze, holding the bra against my breasts.i glance up.nate is gone."yup, i'm home!"i yell back."i saw your shoes!i'm coming up-i want to hear all about your first day."i hear her footsteps on the staircase and hurriedly refasten my bra.nothing like your mom's voice to kill your libido.chapter eight the next couple weeks of my new life seem to pass rather quickly, mostly due to the fact that nate is always out with his friends after work, and our run-ins have been few and far between.i've settled into a routine of sorts, even if i still don't feel like i'm at home here.i'd gone to bed early last night, with the intention of sleeping in this morning before visiting museums with allison later in the day.however a loud noise from downstairs awakens me-i stare bleary eyed at my alarm clock, it's only 6:15am.who'd be awake this early on a saturday morning?i get out of bed and tiptoe to my door.i open it a little and hear something shuffling around downstairs.i tiptoe out into the hallway and see everyone's bedroom doors are closed.i know there's an alarm system-i had to memorize the passcode.maybe an ungainly mouse is exploring?i creep down the staircase and through the dining room.the noises sounded like they were coming from the kitchen.the swinging door is open, and i peak my head around it, my heartbeat blasting in my ears.suddenly, nate steps out in front of me."fuck!"he exclaims, and i jump back, startled."oh, god, i thought you were a burglar.""then you should have called 911," he retorts brusquely, turning his back to me and walking to the island."well, you should be glad i didn't."sheesh, does he have to find something wrong with everything i say?"what are you doing up so early anyway?""i was just working out.""wow.this early?"i ask, moving around him.he's fiddling with something in front of him."yeah, every morning.i need to stay in shape during the off-season.""i'd be exhausted if-" i break off, as i see blood dripping from his palms onto the granite countertop."oh my god, you're bleeding!"i gasp."yeah, i just can't get this fucking tape to..." he struggles to wind a bandage around his palm."let me," i say, spying a first aid kit on the counter by the window.from the blood smeared on it, i can see nate's already gone through it."you don't have to," he protests."come over here.the light's better," i instruct him."do you know what you're doing?"he asks, less than thrilled to accept my help."more than you," i reply with a smile, nodding at the mess of tape around his palm.i wash my hands in the sink and then open up the kit.i take a pair of surgical scissors and cut off the tape that he's already applied.i glance up slightly, and for the first time it hits me that he's shirtless, wearing only a pair of gym shorts and sneakers.he's covered in sweat."how'd this happen?""i over-trained a little.got dizzy, tripped on a rock and held out my hands to break my fall," he replies, eyes downcast as he watches me work."over-training for what?lacrosse or crew?"i ask as i pull out a piece of gauze and a bottle of hydrogen peroxide."both.either," he murmurs."this is going to sting," i warn him, as i pat the gashes on his hands with the soaked gauze.he hisses slightly as the liquid stings him, but doesn't move.i slide my other hand under his, to stabilize it as i cleanse the wound of dirt.i've never touched him this long before."other hand."he switches hands and i go to work cleaning the other one."maybe you should take a little time off from training," i suggest quietly."or i could just work out my leg muscles," he says, and i look up to see a wry grin on his face."mmm," i murmur, smiling too."you know," i go on, a bit more bravely, "i heard that only one varsity athlete got a lawn room, because sports are such a time commitment, much less a two-sport athlete-" "don't do that," he grunts."i don't want your pity.""it's not pity, it's facts.""i was born with everything, i have no excuse for not achieving my all of goals.""where did you hear that?it sounds like-" i break off, feeling him stiffen under my touch.i was going to say his father but i can tell he doesn't want me to go there."you're just really hard on yourself, that's all," i say instead.i gently dab some neosporin onto the cuts."i know what everyone sees when they look at me," he replies quietly."entitled... born with a silver spoon in my mouth... i work as hard as i do so that no one can say i succeed because of my family's wealth."i frown.that's half of the equation i think, but it seems like he doesn't see how hard his father pushes him."i got a little bit of that at work the other day," i say, wondering if it's ok to broach the topic of the internship he wanted.i take a dry piece of gauze and cover his palm with it before picking up the tape and beginning to wrap it around his hand."when they found out i was pierce's stepdaughter, i mean.feels weird.""your first experience of nepotism?""yeah," i say with a smile."actually, my mom once got me a part-time job as the receptionist at the salon where she used to work, so i guess that's not true.""where does your dad work?""no idea.probably a repair shop somewhere.he's a mechanic, or he was.last time we heard from him was several years ago.he was in florida then, but he never stays in one place very long.""so you're the first in your family to go to college," he observes, as i finish taping one hand and move to the other."yep.""is that why you're so serious?""am i?"i ask, my eyes moving up to his."serious isn't the right word... distant, maybe.""distant?that's worse," i reply, feeling a little hurt."i didn't mean to insult you.i'm just trying to figure you out.we were really in class together?which one?""there were three.the first was this american history survey class freshman year.""professor michaels?""yeah.i always sat behind you, though.i'm not surprised you didn't see me," i say, pressing down slightly as i finish wrapping his hands."i am," he replies.i glance up sharply, but his eyes aren't focused on my face.they're looking at my body, which i now realize is quite exposed in my thin, white cotton nightie.i completely forgot i was wearing it.there's a moment of silence, and i suddenly become very aware of every inch of myself, and every inch of him.his smell of sweat, beads of it still dripping forward down his chest, through a smattering of hair between his nipples.allison's face appears in my mind, and i'm reminded of what she said."i'm done.""what?"he says, his eyes pulling up to mine."with your hands.i'm done.""right."i grab a glass from the cabinet and pour him some water from the faucet."here, you felt dizzy because you're dehydrated.""thanks," he says.he reaches for the glass with his left hand, which is closer, and then pauses and takes it awkwardly with his right."what was that?"i ask, frowning."what?""let me see your left arm," i reply, reaching for him, but he pulls back."no, no, it's nothing.""what is?""my shoulder.it's just a little tendonitis.""oh really?did a doctor tell you that?""not exactly.""webmd?"i ask, raising my eyebrows.he shrugs, then winces."you need to take better care of yourself.you can't keep pushing yourself so hard."he frowns, and doesn't respond."well, at least take some tylenol for the pain," i add as i pour two pills into my hand and begin to repack the first aid kit with the other."that's ok." i tilt my head at him."pain isn't going to make you heal any faster," i point out."fine," he says with a little smile.i blush as his fingertips scrape my palm as he takes the pills."well.i think i'm going back to bed.i'm supposed to check out some of the smithsonian museums later, so..." i trail off, feeling awkward now."ok, see you later," he says, turning toward the back door.i pause for a moment, then head back toward the staircase.just like that, the one real conversation that my stepbrother and i have ever had is over.i could practically feel him closing back up at the end there.i climb the steps and shut my bedroom door behind me.i feel more confused now than ever about our relationship.i didn't think it could get any weirder after that peep show i gave him, but somehow this candid glimpse of him makes things even more complicated.i close my eyes and try to fall back to sleep, but when my alarm goes off at ten, i'm still wide awake.chapter nine the humidity is really starting to thicken by the middle of june, and it's a wonder that i haven't taken advantage of our pool yet.the only swimsuit i have is an old athletic one-piece, and i pull it on reluctantly in my bedroom.my mom keeps asking me if i want to go shopping, but i haven't taken her up on it yet.all her new clothes look wonderful but i think i'd feel uncomfortable spending so much money on myself.i head down the hallway and almost bump into nate as he leaves his bedroom.i reflexively cross my hands over my chest, even though i know he's seen me in less."hey," i say."hey," he replies.it's the same conversation we've had ever since i saw him in the kitchen that morning.we quickly slipped into polite, but formal, interactions with each other afterward.if i had to choose between this and the mind games we started out with, i might choose the mind games.the doorbell rings and i start to move past him to answer it."it's ok i'll get it.it's my friend jackson."he walks down the hallway toward the stairs.i follow after him, and turn toward the backyard once we're in the foyer.i hear his friend walk in just as i exit the french doors.there's a chest set against the house with the outdoor towels in it, so i grab one and set it on a chair.the area around the pool it is paved with light stones before it turns into grass, and lounge chairs and a table with an umbrella are carefully set around it.i turn to the pool and step gingerly onto the first step in the shallow end.it's nice-warm, but still refreshing in the hot summer day.i step down the rest of the way until the water circles around my stomach, and then dive forward.i swim to the other end, where the water gets darker and deeper, then push off and glide onto my back.i open my eyes as i push the water past me with my hands and look up toward the house rising against the sun on my left.a flash of movement in the second floor window grabs my attention.there's a figure moving there, pulling a curtain aside.at first i think it's nate-it's his room, i think-but then i catch a glimpse of blonde hair.must be his friend jackson.i turn onto my stomach and dive back under the water.i want nate to be the one watching me.i was never much into sports, but i've always wondered if i'd be any good at them.i push harder for the last couple laps and finally pull my head up at the shallow end, gasping for breath.i take the steps back out of the pool and walk around to my towel and dry off my hair, then drape it onto the chair and lay down on it.i can feel the suit clinging to my torso, and water sitting in my belly button.i hear the door to the house open behind me and shield my eyes from the sun as i turn around to see who it is.jackson bounds out of the door, his face spread in a genial grin."hey, you must be brynn.i'm jackson, one of nate's oldest friends.""nice to meet you," i say as we shake hands.i notice nate lagging behind, standing just outside the door and looking reluctant to put another foot toward the pool."come on, man, let's get in.i've been dreaming about this pool for days.""we shouldn't bother her, she likes to be alone," nate says reluctantly.jackson pulls off his shirt, and i look down at my interlaced fingers in my lap.he's got a great body.maybe not as good as nate's, but whose is?jackson kicks off his flip-flops and jumps in, his splash narrowly missing me.nate slowly walks toward the chair furthest from me, and takes off his shirt.i watch his back muscles tense as he lifts it off his head."nate and i grew up playing lacrosse together," jackson says, swimming to the edge of the pool and leaning his elbows onto the deck in front of me."hm?oh," i reply, as nate dives in the deep end."so you guys go to school together?""yup.uva-i mean, of course you knew that.""which sorority are you in?"he asks, pushing his wet hair out of his eyes."i'm not.it's expensive, and i'm already pretty busy with work.um, where do you go?"nate pops up next to jackson.they make quite a pair, nate with his dark eyes and jackson with his light blonde locks."you wan na get some food now?"nate asks."dude we just got here.besides, you're not supposed to eat for thirty minutes after you swim.""before," nate and i both chime in.we glance at each other as he continues."you're not supposed to eat for thirty minutes before.why wouldn't it be ok to eat after you swim?""i dunno," jackson replies, flashing me a blindingly white smile."just thought that was the rule."i find myself smiling back at him.he has a boyish charm that's infectious."i'm pretty sure that's a myth adults made up so they'd have time to eat their own lunch without the kids swimming unsupervised."i smile."ah that makes more sense.you grow up around here?"he asks me."yeah, on the eastern shore.""oh, sweet.my family has a vacation house there.i love going out there.sailing in the bay and everything.you go sailing a lot?""um, not really," i reply.nate kicks off the wall and begins to swim back and forth behind jackson.i guess he's decided not to take it easy on his injured shoulder."we should go some time.maybe not with him," he replies, nodding behind him."too competitive.""he is, isn't he?"it feels nice to be able to talk about nate with someone who knows him.and who will gossip."was he always like that?""oh man, always.we're like, ten years old, playing lacrosse on our school team, and coach was constantly having to pull him back during practice'cause he was always going full out, full contact."he and i laugh together.i notice nate pause in his stroke, but i can't imagine he can hear us."do you still play lacrosse?""naw, i don't really have the discipline to keep up with it.i was good in high school, but you have to be great to cut it in college.what sport do you play?""oh, none.""really?you look like you're so in shape.""oh, thanks," i reply, managing to only blush a bit.from anyone else it would have seemed like a ham-fisted compliment, but jackson has such a natural, easygoing way about him."you going to this party in georgetown tonight?"he asks, dunking his head briefly underneath the water, then shaking off his hair like a dog."what party?""oh, i figured nate told you.""told her what?"nate asks, appearing next to him."'bout chris's party," jackson replies nonchalantly.nate's jaw muscles twitch."hadn't mentioned it," he replies shortly."well, you should come," jackson says, turning back to me."she's not going to know anyone, and i think it's just gon na be a small thing," nate says."dude, chris said to invite anyone.they've got the whole townhouse.it's gon na be great.""i just-" nate begins, as i bite my lip.here i thought we were maybe getting along better, despite the awkwardness, and now he's going out of his way to exclude me."if you're worried about being a third wheel, just invite dana or someone," jackson says, though even when he's arguing, he doesn't seem to have a care in the world."so, what do you think?"he asks me."sounds great, actually," i say, glancing at nate, feeling a bit gratified as he glares at me.it feels good to spite him a little, since he so clearly doesn't want me to go."awesome.tonight then.we can go together-i'll pick you guys up around ten," jackson says, before jumping on top of nate and trying to wrestle him under the water.i close my eyes as they disappear.for the first time in a while, i wish i had something cute to wear.chapter ten in the end, i have to go with the same black top i wore to that crew party.it's really my only top suitable for a party, i think.besides, nate's the only one who's seen me in it, and i doubt he remembers.my mom excitedly waves goodbye as nate and i walk out to jackson's green suv.she is so thrilled that i might have a social life that it's embarrassing.jackson opens up the front passenger door for me and nate slides in back."we picking up dana?"jackson asks as we pull away."it's natasha tonight.and she's meeting us there," nate answers from the back seat.i guess i'm relieved, because i don't think i could look dana in the eye after seeing her and nate having sex by the pool."oh, fuck, natasha, of course," jackson says, laughing and hitting the steering wheel.i frown a little.i guess it's par for the course for my stepbrother.jackson picks up most of the slack in the conversation, and the radio does the rest.i'm too nervous and stuck in my head, thinking of what i should say, while nate mumbles one word responses from the back.i'm relieved when we find a parking space on the street near the party.as we walk toward the riotous townhouse, i'm surprised the neighbors haven't already called the cops.people are spilling out the front door and i can hear the music halfway down the block.there's a pretty olive-skinned girl standing on the curb who turns her head as nate calls out, "natasha!"she smiles coyly as we walk up.nate dips her in a jokingly romantic manner and plants a kiss on her lips as she breaks out into giggles."come on," jackson says, draping an arm around my shoulders protectively and escorting me inside.he high-fives a few guys as we walk in, and he guides me to a keg in the middle of the living room, which is strung with little white christmas lights.there's an impenetrable crowd around it but somehow he manages to snag me a beer, and before i know it i'm taking my first sip of the summer.with his hand on the small of my back, we walk into the next room.the dining room table is being used for a beer pong game, and jackson and i take a seat on a couch nearby."you're gorgeous, you know that?"jackson whispers in my ear.i'm startled and almost spit out my beer."no..." i look down, blushing, "i mean, that's sweet of you to say.""i'd love to see you again after tonight.maybe we could get dinner next weekend," he offers."oh, sure," i reply, feeling flattered.i mean, it does feel a little... rushed, or something, but i've heard so many stories about guys just wanting to hook up, that it's refreshing to be asked out on an old-fashioned date.i take a few more sips of my beer as i look around, feeling more comfortable now that i know jackson is really into me."hey, i'm going to get another beer," i tell jackson, as i drain mine.he jumps up."don't worry about it.i'll grab'em," he says, walking confidently into the other room.i watch the ping pong ball as it's thrown back and forth across the table, and jackson is soon back with the beers.he launches into a story about this crazy party he went to back at school, but out of the corner of my eye i notice a couple walking up the stairs at the rear of the room, their hands all over each other, and feel a stab of envy in my chest.i am beyond tired of being a virgin.it's certainly not on purpose that i'm twenty-one and still haven't had sex yet.i guess i just assumed it would happen somehow, without my ever putting any thought into it, and i've never built it up like it's going to be some crazy special thing, either.i look at jackson out of the corner of my eye as i make quick work of my second beer.maybe nate was right-maybe i am too serious and distant.maybe it would be better if i just got it out of the way.and i bet jackson would be good at it.really, really good at it.plus, he's a decent guy."... don't you think?"jackson asks me, leaning in."yes, right," i reply, even though i spaced out and have no idea what he was talking about.my hair falls in front of my face as i take another sip of beer, and jackson reaches up and tucks it behind my ear.we make eye contact and he leans forward slowly, brushing a soft kiss across my neck."want to get out of here?"he murmurs into my ear, sending a little shiver down my spine."my place is pretty close by, and we'll actually be able to hear ourselves think.""um, yeah, that sounds good," i reply, a little nervously.jackson stands and offers me his hand.i place mine in his and he leads me out toward the front.we pass nate on the way, with his arms wrapped around natasha and his hands tucked into her back pockets."hey man, we're taking off.you think you can find another ride?"jackson asks."what do you mean?you're both leaving?"nate asks, frowning."yup, we're going back to my place, dude," jackson replies."you cool for a ride?""yeah, come here for a second," nate says, his eyes flicking back and forth between us.he takes jackson's arm and pulls him toward a screen door in the back."not you," he says to me, as i begin to follow.i bristle at his tone.they disappear out back and i look after them, my mouth open in shock and annoyance.i can't believe the way nate talks to me sometimes.so dismissively.i exchange a polite smile with natasha, who is now looking around the party aimlessly, clearly bored without nate.screw nate.i'll do whatever the hell i please, and i want to know what he's saying.i brush past natasha, push open the screen door and walk into the small, fenced-in backyard.there are fewer people out here, but there's still a crowd.i can just see nate and jackson talking in a back corner.i weave my way through the people, keeping my head down so they don't notice me.i take out my phone so i look like i'm doing something other than eavesdropping, and sidle into the group nearest to them.i can just overhear what they're saying."why, do you want her nate?"jackson asks angrily.my eyes widen."fuck no, she's my stepsister.it's just weird, that's all.you two.she's not your type."i feel a stab of pain at the finality of nate's words."she's gorgeous," i hear jackson reply."you think she's gorgeous?"nate says, beginning to laugh."seriously?dude, come on.besides, she's a fucking buzz kill."i don't want to hear any more.i can already feel angry tears building up behind my eyes.i'm so stupid.why do i keep giving nate the benefit of the doubt, when he is so clearly such an asshole?i walk quickly back inside, through the living room, and out to the street.i turn toward the left, where i can see a busier street, and hustle toward it.i know it's going to be a pricey cab ride back to the house, but i feel like i'm about to explode into a puddle of tears.and i don't want to give nate the satisfaction of seeing me cry.chapter eleven i breathe in as deeply as possible and hold it, counting to ten before exhaling as slowly as i can, trying to rid myself of the hurt feeling that followed me home from the party.it's a trick i learned to control my anxiety, and to say that i'm anxious right now would be an understatement.i can't remember the last time i heard someone talk about me like that, though i suppose it's partially my fault for eavesdropping.i finally start to feel calm enough to go to sleep, and reach to turn off my bedside lamp.a rush of footsteps up the stairs makes me pause.i sit up a bit as they continue down the hallway toward my bedroom.a second later, my bedroom door bursts open and nate walks in, his face dark with anger."you're in bed?you've got ta be fucking kidding me.that was really selfish of you to run off without telling anyone, you know that?"he spits at me, then turns around and walks out.i'm frozen in shock for a moment.what the hell was that?what does he have to be mad at me for?i leap out from under my covers and march out of my bedroom just in time to stop him from shutting his door.he swings around as i charge into his room."i'm selfish?you are just... you are just..." i stumble in my anger, trying to think of the right word."yeah, you're selfish, brynn!i looked around that party for you for thirty minutes!i thought you might have been kidnapped!i almost called the cops!""wait... what?"i reply, completely thrown."ever heard of a text message?"he asks, his voice laden with sarcasm."yes, i've heard of a text message!"man, i wish i were better at arguing."hey, wait a second, this isn't about me, this is about you!you're the asshole!i heard what you were saying about me to jackson, i'm not a buzzkill, and maybe i'm not gorgeous, but i'm not some kind of joke, either!"i fight back the tears welling in my eyes, more angry than i've ever been in my life.there, that got him.he stands dumbfounded and i seize the opportunity to walk out.just as i'm about to cross the threshold, he reaches around me and closes the door in front of me.i stop short and turn around angrily, almost ready to smack him.he's standing so close to me i'm practically pinned against the door."wait, what?how'd you hear that?you followed us outside?""yes, i followed you," i reply, stumbling a bit because i know i was wrong in that regard."i was mad because you were obviously trying to stop me from leaving with jackson, and i wanted to know why."i take a deep breath."i guess i can't control what you think about me, and that's... whatever, that's fine, but i don't know why you had to go sharing your opinion with jackson.i mean, am i really that unattractive to you?"to my horror, my lower lip starts to tremble.i don't want to cry right now but i can't hold back the tears any longer."no... shit, that's not what..." nate says, his eyes widen as a tear slips down my cheek.i furiously brush it away and nate backs up, running his hands through his wavy hair."it's not that i don't want jackson to date you, it's that i don't want you to date jackson.""what?that doesn't make any sense," i reply, trying to staunch the flow of tears as i tug at my hair."jackson's track record with women is pretty bad.they're just conquests to him."i cross my arms and frown at him."that sounds pretty hypocritical.i mean, the first time we met, you asked me to have a threesome with you and you didn't even know my name."a smile tugs at the corner of his mouth."ok, that's fair.for the record, you just looked so shocked, and innocent-i couldn't resist.you're right, it's not like i have a great track record either.i guess the difference, in my mind, is that i'm upfront about it.i've never promised a woman a relationship.the girls i sleep with, they know that it's not going anywhere because i tell them that.jackson pulls them in by promising them a future with him, and then as soon as he sleeps with them, he acts like they don't exist.""but you're friends with him..." i point out."well, he's a good friend.loyal, funny..." "but he sounds like a bad person.i just...i don't know why you'd want to be friends with a person like that.sorry, maybe i'm just..." i shake my head, trying to process this new version of events."he did... what you just said about him does match up with some things he was saying to me.god, i can't believe i fell for it.""he wasn't always like that," nate says quietly, gesturing vaguely to a framed photo sitting on his desk.i glance at it, then walk over to get a closer look."oh my god, is that you?"i ask, picking it up.it's a class photo from elementary school, three rows of smiling kids with their teacher standing next to them.nate is easy to spot."you look so serious, like you're on the way to the office or something."nate peers over my shoulder at it, his face an exact reflection of his younger self."that was the year my mom left," he says quietly."oh.oh, i'm sorry.do you ever see her?""no.she made her choice."he pauses for a moment."that one's jackson," he says, pointing out a grinning towheaded boy.i snort.he had a flirtatious smile even back then."i'm sorry you heard me say those things.jackson's the kind of guy who, if you tell him something's off limits, that makes him want it even more.he's never been denied anything.so i thought it would be better to convince him that he didn't want you in the first place."i fiddle with the edge of the frame and then turn to face him.he's standing closer than i thought he was."so... you don't think those things about me?"i whisper, feeling suddenly vulnerable."no, the exact opposite, really," he replies, equally softly."brynn you are gorgeous."there's a charged moment between us.i can't rip my gaze away from his eyes.i realize he's moving forward ever so slowly, and my lips automatically part, my body taking over from my brain.every inch of my skin tingles, and i suddenly feel brave-a completely different reaction than anything i've ever felt being this close to jackson.just before his mouth touches mine, i close my eyes.as our lips come together, an exquisite feeling rushes through me, unlike anything i've ever felt before.his lips graze mine, then return a bit more firmly, guiding me into a kiss.i've been kissed by a handful of guys over the years, but this kiss is something else.nate is something else.his hands wrap around my waist and slide to the small of my back as his lips crush against mine.all my thoughts evaporate, all my worries and insecurities-maybe it's that i can tell he knows exactly what he's doing, and so i can let myself go, trust myself in his hands.he nudges me slightly with his nose and his lower lip brushes against mine.i almost gasp as i feel his tongue move smoothly into my mouth.electricity flies straight from my mouth to the base of my hips.i press my tongue against his as my hands move of their own accord up to his chest.i lay my palms against his pecs and feel his racing heartbeat under his rapidly rising and falling chest.it's my first hint that there's something else hiding under his completely confident exterior.his tongue moves deeper into my mouth, and his hands pull me close against his body.i wrap my arms around his neck and run my fingers through the hair falling onto the collar of his polo.i can feel his erection pushing against my stomach as he slides one hand over my ass.i want nothing more than to rip my clothes off, jump on his bed, and be ravaged by him... to feel his mouth all over my body... inside me...suddenly he pulls away.i almost fall forward in surprise as my eyes blink open."i shouldn't have done that," he mutters."why?"i whisper, falling quickly from my cloud."it's wrong... you're my stepsister.maybe it's best if we just keep our distance from each other.""yeah, you're right..." i reply, feeling like he's just slapped me in the face.i walk quickly to the door.i pause before i open it, wishing i could put into words what i'm feeling, but i can't.i open the door and close it softly behind me before rushing to my room.as i curl up under the covers, i try to wrap my mind around all the twists this night has taken.i can't believe nate and i just kissed.i mean, i've been dreaming about that moment since i first laid eyes on him freshman year.i've found that most things in life don't live up to how i've built them up in my head, but that kiss far surpassed any fantasy.i can feel my body reacting at just the thought of his lips touching mine again.but is he right?was it wrong of us to do that?light is creeping around the sides of my shades by the time i manage to fall asleep, and i still haven't managed to find an answer.chapter twelve nate and i pass the next few weeks as though we're each surrounded by an invisible force field.whenever one of us enters a room, the other is propelled out of it.we're only pushed into close proximity with each other when we have a family dinner, though my mom has been pushing those on us quite frequently in an effort to bond.if she only knew.today, though, nate's and my presence is required at the same event : the thornhill's annual fourth of july party.it's in our very own backyard, starting in the afternoon with a crab boil and extending through the evening fireworks.apparently we'll get a good view of the country club's annual fireworks display just down the river.my mom has absolutely insisted on buying me a new dress for the occasion, and even came into the fitting room with me to make sure it fit correctly.the shift dress is not exactly my style, but i've seen it on plenty of girls at school.i'm just worried about spilling tartar sauce on the bright white fabric.i pull on my new pair of gold wedges, and walk downstairs to see if my mom needs any help.i'm taken aback by the flurry of activity downstairs.as i walk outside, i realize i've underestimated the scale of this party.when i heard "crab boil," i was picturing a few picnic tables with red and white tablecloths, but this is clearly a classy affair.there are elegant round tables set, with flowing linens and extravagant centerpieces on top of them.the food is presented in silver trays, and garlands festoon the perimeter.i spot my mom talking in hushed, urgent tones to one of the caterers, and head over."oh, brynn, you look beautiful!that dress fits you so well," she gushes."thanks... do you need any help?""mmm, no.i think we're ok.the guests should begin arriving in about ten minutes.oh, go taste the freedom martini over at the bar and tell me what you think.i'm worried it's a little too sweet.""the freedom martini?""the signature cocktail we created for this event," the caterer next to her chimes in with a chipper grin."ah, of course," i reply, heading for the bar.the bartender serves me a pale pink drink and i take a sip.not too sweet-it's delicious, light and refreshing.luckily the day isn't too hot, anyway.the temperature has managed to stay below ninety degrees for the party.i decide to go down to the river since i'd just feel in the way while they're setting up.i walk down to the lower lawn and down the steps.as i reach the shore, i navigate the rocky sand cautiously in my heels.a splash on the other side of the large boulder grabs my attention.i walk toward it and peer around.nate's standing there, skipping rocks with a smooth sidearm motion.i pause, admiring his form, then decide it's best to just go back up to the lawn before he notices me.he's made it clear he doesn't want to talk to me.i turn back and as i walk my heel catches on a rock.i gasp as i slip sideways, and feel two strong hands catching me under my arms to hold me up."whoa, careful," he says as he straightens me up."thanks," i reply as i turn to him and tuck my hair back behind my ears."you escaping from the commotion, too?""yeah.i don't really enjoy these things.""really?you're so..." i trail off."what?"he asks with a grin.i groan."fine.i was going to say'charming,' ok?""i knew it," he replies jokingly."well, whatever charm you might be noticing has been developed over many years of practice.my dad has been dragging me to these kinds of events for years.i know the routine.smile, shake hands, tell the kinds of jokes that don't make anyone think too hard.""sounds... horrible.but at least there's a lot of free food."he gives me a bemused glance."right.sometimes i forget i don't have to worry about that stuff anymore.""you were, um, not well-off before our parents-" he drops his gaze."i'd say we were struggling.but it was just the way i grew up.i never wanted for anything big, though we certainly frequented the goodwill racks often enough.but i don't want you to think... i mean, my mom, she really cares for pierce.""relax-i don't think your mom's a gold digger.there have always been some of those around, and i can practically smell them at this point.i mean, maybe at first i was worried, but i'm not now.""was your mom-" i begin, feeling brave."i don't like to talk about her," he cuts me off, and chucks another rock out onto the water.it hits the surface with a plopping sound and sinks."sorry," i whisper."how's your shoulder?""hurts," he replies shortly."i'll see you up there," i say after a moment, since he's clearly done with the conversation."hey," he calls after me as i climb the steps."jackson and his parents are here.they're family friends.they're on the guest list every year.""got it, thanks," i reply, before mounting the rest of the steps.that was considerate of him, and it sounds like he was telling me that he didn't invite jackson himself.as i walk across the lawn, i can see that the first guests are beginning to arrive.i wonder if now that i'm pierce's stepdaughter, i'm going be expected to put on the same song-and-dance routine as nate.usually if i have to go to a party, like my aunt's christmas party, i'll hang out for a while, and then disappear somewhere to read a book.my fears are realized as my mom waves me over to where she and pierce are standing with two guests.i'm introduced to the couple, who turn out to be higher-ups for the state department, and my accomplishments are trotted out while they murmur enthusiastically, though i have to wonder if anyone could possibly be genuinely interested in such self-serving prattle.as we talk, my mom breaks away to greet the guests that are now pouring in.i listen politely as pierce chats away, impressed with his wit and charm.clearly nate gets it from his dad, even if he does insist that it's a learned skill.i manage to slip away and head over to the buffet table.like any good maryland girl, i absolutely love crabs.as i pile my plate high, i feel a hand on the small of my back.i turn to see jackson grinning at me.with his open, friendly face, it's hard to keep in mind what nate told me about him, and what i experienced for myself."hey, brynn!"he says, brushing a kiss against my cheek."jackson, good to see you," i reply politely."you disappeared so fast the last time i saw you!i was worried," he replies."sorry about that," i respond, wondering if nate gave him any explanation."we ever going to go on that date?"i'm saved by the sight of allison walking out onto the deck."could you excuse me for a moment?my best friend just got here and she doesn't know anyone else," i explain as i slip away.i wave at her as i approach, but she's looking around nervously and doesn't register my presence."allison!"i call out, just ten feet from her."oh!oh my gosh, i didn't recognize you," she says.i give her a hug as i walk up."this party is really fancy!and this house!i mean you said it was big, but i didn't think it was this big.""i know," i groan."i'll give you a tour later if you have a couple hours," i add wryly."come get something to eat with me-i was just filling up a plate.i'm so glad you're here.i don't really know anyone else, and none of the interns have shown up yet.""the interns?"allison asks as we head back over to the buffet, where i pick up my abandoned plate."yeah, pierce invited all the interns from the office.""oh, that was nice of him," allison comments, picking up her own plate."wow, i think that guy's a senator... the one in the blue seersucker jacket."i glance over."from georgia, yeah," i confirm."i think he and pierce served in congress at the same time."i start giggling and allison looks at me with a questioning smile."sorry, i just can't believe i'm talking about my stepfather serving in congress.""this is your real life!"allison says, laughing."when do you think it'll sink in?""no idea," i reply as we head toward a couple empty seats at one of the tables."your mom looks really happy," allison observes as we sit.i watch her for a moment, flitting between conversations, so beautiful and animated."i think she is.and she's just really good at cocktail-type conversation, too.like nate, though he says it doesn't come to him naturally.""brynn..." allison says, raising an eyebrow at me."no, i mean, i'm just, you know..." i reply, trailing off.definitely not the time to tell allison that nate and i kissed, though i don't know if that time will ever come.i love allison, but thinking in shades of grey is not her strong suit."thought you two could use some drinks."i look up to see greg, the cute intern with the strawberry-blonde hair, standing next to us, three martini glasses carefully balanced between his long fingers."greg, hi!i'm so glad you could make it."i indicate the chair next to us and help him place down the glasses so that they don't spill their contents."greg, this is my friend allison.we go to college together.""nice to meet you," allison says."you too.hope these drinks are ok with you.i forget what the bartender called them..." "freedom martinis," i answer, rolling my eyes."the name sucks, but they're really good.""so where are you from originally, greg?"allison asks."raleigh, though i hope to move to dc after i graduate."i tune out slightly as allison and greg talk across me.i've just seen nate cross between groups of people, seeming to make conversation effortlessly.i look around to see if there's a girl trailing him, but i don't see one.this might be the first time i've seen him without a date at any kind of gathering.the idea that it could be because of me comes to my mind, but i quickly quash it.i can't let myself think like that.nate doesn't want that kind of relationship with me, probably even if i weren't his stepsister.i bet his date just got a cold last-minute or something."be right back," allison says."i have to get a second helping!"my attention snaps back to greg as she stands and leaves.he scratches his cheek and clears his throat.i smile as a blush sneaks onto his freckle-dotted skin."you look... um, that's a nice dress," he finally says."thanks."i smile, careful not to linger on the subject, "so, you think you'll want to work in politics after school ends?""well, in government," he says with a smile."though i'm learning that one doesn't seem to exist without the other.i guess i need to work on the whole... you know..." he waves his hand vaguely."kissing babies thing?""exactly," he smiles."so, ah, i was wondering..." my attention drifts from him again as i see my mom and pierce talking urgently by the house.my mom covers her face with her hands and pierce turns back to the party, his frown turning into a smile as if by magic."i'm so sorry, greg, could you excuse me?i think my mom might need me.""oh, sure," he replies kindly as i rush toward the door into the study.my mind runs through the possible scenarios as i hurry through the study and up the stairs.as i climb the second set of stairs up to the master suite on the third floor, i decide it must be my father.the last time i saw my mom look that upset, it was because my dad was back in town and pressuring her for money.i knock softly on the closed double door of their bedroom."mom?"i whisper quietly as i let myself in."what's wrong?"i gasp as i hurry in.she's curled up on top of the bedspread, like a broken doll."it's pierce," she murmurs without moving."his lawyer just called him.a woman has come forward accusing him of sexual harassment.it'll be on the news tomorrow."chapter thirteen "oh no," i whisper, sitting next to her on the bed."i'm so sorry, mom.""is it... is it me?"she asks, turning her head as a tear drops down her cheek."what?what do you mean?""maybe it's me... maybe it's my fault.it's like i'm a curse.""no, mom, no," i whisper, leaning down and pulling her hair out of her eyes."this isn't happening because of you.i mean, when did this even go on?the, you know, the..." i reply, unable to repeat those two ugly words : sexual harassment."several years ago," she replies."long before he ever met you," i point out."so, what?this woman's going on tv?"my mom nods."one of those investigation shows is doing a piece about sexual harassment in politics, and she's going to be interviewed.""what are you going to do?""well, we'll have to batten down the hatches.we'll probably have to stay in the house for a few days, though luckily tomorrow's saturday anyway.""no, that's not what i meant.i mean, if pierce sexually harassed a-" "i don't want to think about it.""mom, you have to," i sigh.she's always been like the child in our relationship.i'm tired of the dynamic, but i don't know how to break the pattern without our entire relationship falling apart."if pierce did that, then maybe you have to-" "don't say it.pierce and i are staying together.that's not a question.and even if he did do it, i'm sure it was a momentary weakness.it was just something that happened a long time ago, and he's changed."i shrug, feeling helpless."i want that to be true, mom, i really do.not for his sake, but for yours.i did hear a rumor at work, though," i say hesitatingly."what do you mean?what kind of rumor?""that... pierce has a certain reputation.""why didn't you tell me?"i want to tell her that it's because she's so fragile, but instead i just reply, "because it was just a rumor that i heard from one person.i had no way of knowing if it were true.""well, until there's some evidence or something, i'm going to believe pierce.he said she was a woman at work who was denied a promotion she wanted, and now she's starting a jewelry line, and thought she might as well put her bitterness to good use and drum up some publicity.""i guess that could be it," i say without conviction.my mom nods."i think i just want to be alone for a while.do you think you could go back to the party, and sort of act like the hostess for me?you know, make sure everyone's having a good time and all that?just say i have a headache if anyone asks after me.""um, alright," i reply, not knowing what else to say."thanks, honey," my mom says, settling back onto the pillow.i stand and head for the door."i just can't believe it," i hear her murmur as i close the bedroom door behind me.i wish i didn't believe it either, but there's a telltale knot in the pit of my stomach that's telling me i do.i head back down to the party, taking the stairs slowly.i'd rather be doing pretty much anything else right now than plastering a smile on my face and pretending everything's fine.but i know my mom's right-it will look odd if both of us disappear during the party.i reemerge out back and take a deep breath as i cross back over to greg and allison."sorry about that.my mom has a headache, i just wanted to check on her," i relay dutifully.greg and allison murmur sympathetically.i finish the rest of my food quickly, and with only one ear on their conversation, before standing up with my drink.i excuse myself and begin to mingle, trying to circulate and play the part of the hostess like my mom asked.i watch the fading light impatiently; willing the sun to set as fast as possible so that this party can finally be over.the chipper event organizer i met earlier appears quietly at my side as i force a laugh at a partygoer's joke."have you seen mrs.thornhill?"it still throws me to hear my mom referred to like that."she's not feeling well.can i help you with something?""would you like the lanterns to be lit now, or should we wait?"i glance around at the dimming light."now would be fine, thanks."she hurries away and i spot nate across the party, frowning at me.i avert my gaze quickly.if his dad hasn't told him what's going on yet, i don't want the task to fall on me.i see him making his way over, and excuse myself from my current conversation to disappear into a large group of people around the pool.just another hour or so and the fireworks will be done, and everyone will leave.the caterers move throughout the party, lighting candles on the tables and mini chinese lanterns strung in the trees.i take a moment to admire the scene : the beautiful white lights, the well-heeled crowd, the murmur of easy conversation.my mom does know how to throw a good party.i grab another drink as the twilight turns into night and people begin heading down to the lower lawn to get a better view of the fireworks.with a sudden boom, the display begins.there are a few exclamations of excitement and some clapping as the crowd gathers to stare downriver at the explosions of color.i'm making my way toward the rear of the crowd when i feel a hand on the small of my back.i know before i even turn around that it's nate."what's going on?"he asks quietly, as i turn to face him."it's nothing.my mom just isn't feeling well," i reply."you're pulling at your hair," he points out, and i drop my hand, feeling caught.the crowd cheers as an especially colorful firework goes off above us."so?""i can read you like a book, brynn," he replies, leaning in.i can feel his breath on my cheek and step back, feeling flustered."i just think it's something that your dad should tell you," i say, and turn back to the fireworks, but i feel his hand on my elbow."would you just tell me?you and my dad are both acting strangely, and now your mom disappears... i just want to know.""and here i thought i was covering well," i say, stalling for time."maybe to other people, but not to me."i stare at him for a moment as his features are illuminated by the light of one of my favorite, willow-shaped fireworks."there's a woman... she's going to go on the news tomorrow and say that your dad sexually harassed her.""that's crazy," he hisses at me."i'm just the messenger-you insisted i tell you-" i stammer, taken aback by his tone."my dad, he's a great man.he's a pillar of the community-" "a pillar of the community?""what?he is!""it's just, sometimes the way you talk about him... he's not perfect, nate.""you don't know anything about him.when my mom abandoned us, he took care of me all by himself.he's always been there for me.""ok, i'm just-" but nate storms off back to the house.i stand in shock for a moment.i knew that conversation wasn't going to be fun, but i didn't think he'd turn on me like that, as though i were attacking pierce, or something.i turn back toward the crowd just as the finale begins and the sky lights up.i glance at the people around me, their faces upturned, their expressions joyous.maybe it was silly of me to look forward to everyone leaving.because now i realize that tomorrow, it will be back to the four of us alone in the house-and no buffer zone.my eyes fall on pierce and i realize he's staring at me.he smiles quickly when he realizes that i'm looking at him, and leads the applause as the last firework dies out.chapter fourteen i was half-worried that the plan was for all four of us to watch the tv program together, but thankfully there's no such expectation.or at least, i haven't been told of it.it's the first time in a while my mom hasn't insisted on a family dinner.she's been holed up in her room most of the day, while pierce fields calls from his attorneys in his study.i decide to grab some leftover pasta from the fridge to eat in my room, and peer into nate's room as i pass.no sign of him.i shut my door behind me and open my computer to check out some of the coverage online.i feel nauseous as i read the woman's claims, though slightly relieved that she isn't accusing pierce of any kind of violence.she talks mostly about lingering touches, shoulder massages, and being stonewalled by management when she complained.i finish eating and click around the internet for a while, feeling restless.when i can't stand my boredom any longer, i take my plate and walk back down to the kitchen and put it in the dishwasher.the phone on the counter rings as i'm headed past it.i pause for a moment, waiting to see if someone else is going to answer it.what if it's a reporter?do i just say'no comment,' like they do on tv?on the third ring, i decide to bite the bullet."hello?""hi, is nate there?"a female voice asks breathlessly.ah, another admirer."sorry, i don't think he is," i reply honestly."can i take a message?"there's a slight pause."is this holly?""no, this is her daughter, brynn.may i ask who's calling?"there's another long pause, and i begin to feel uneasy."it's eileen... nate's mom."i almost drop the phone in surprise."oh, um, i don't-" "wait!please, please don't hang up.i just saw the news, and thought that nate might be willing to talk to me now.""i don't understand.""because he'll know the truth about pierce, and then maybe he won't believe whatever he says about me.""i'm sorry, i don't think i should be in the middle of this."whatever it is."please, please..." i hear her gasp and the clear sound of crying."i haven't talked to nate in so long... he's my son, he's my son.""but you chose to leave him..." "is that what pierce told you?""no, nate.""he heard it from pierce.i left pierce because he was cheating on me.but pierce is used to having everything his own way, and he was furious.he was the one with the money, i came into the marriage with nothing, and signed a pre-nup.i mean, i barely even looked at the thing at the time-i thought we'd be together forever.he had an expensive lawyer and managed to get full custody in the divorce.i never had a chance.i've been trying to get in touch with nate for years to tell him the truth... i left pierce, not nate.i would never leave my son.i never would have divorced pierce, even though he was cheating on me, if i had known i'd never see my son again.i thought after seeing this woman on tv, maybe he'd believe me..." she dissolves into sobs."eileen, eileen, it's ok," i whisper, feeling sick.something about what she's telling me rings true.i can feel it in my gut."i want to help you, but... nate, he's really touchy about his father.i don't know what i can do.""i know, and i'm sorry to put this on you.i call the house now and then trying to get nate, and i was just hoping that he would pick up tonight and not hang up on me."a sound behind me makes me fly around.pierce is standing in the doorway to the dining room."everything ok?"he asks."yep, everything's fine, pierce," i reply so that eileen can hear me."just take down my number, alright?"eileen says quietly."please, just tell him what i said."i write the number down on a small notepad on the counter, conscious that pierce is watching me."got it, thanks.talk to you later," i say, and hang up."not a reporter, i hope," pierce says with a sad smile."no, just a friend," i reply as nonchalantly as possible, and rip the paper off the pad and stuff it in my pocket."god, this has been the longest day of my life," he says with a sigh, running his fingers through his hair."i hope you and your mom don't get dragged into anything.there might be some reporters hanging out by the gate tomorrow.probably best to just avoid them.""sure, no problem."he looks so tired, and i find myself quickly feeling sorry for him.he seems so genuine right now that it's hard to believe what eileen and this other woman are saying about him.the man in front of me paints such a different picture."on the other hand, though, i'm glad that you and your mom are here right now.maybe it's selfish of me.but i don't think i'd make it through all this without her.she's really brought light back into my life.""she's... yeah, she's great," i reply awkwardly."are you having a good time at the internship?not too much busy work, i hope.""no, not at all, pierce.it's wonderful, thank you."he nods."well, i better get back to work.you'd think i'd have gotten a lot done, considering how long i've been in there, but i've just been staring at the wall.""oh, well, i'll see you tomorrow then.""'night.""goodnight."i walk back upstairs with the phone number burning a hole in my pocket.it's amazing to me that i've gone from being almost sure that pierce is lying, to feeling like i've betrayed his trust in the span of one short conversation with him.is he telling the truth, or does he just possess a consummate politician's ability to spin the story for himself?i get ready for bed slowly, my mind wandering uncontrollably.before this summer, i felt sure of things in my life.sure of my ideas and opinions.sure that i was right.but i feel less and less sure of myself the longer i stay in this house.just as i finish brushing my teeth, i hear a thud from the hallway, then a groan.that sounded like nate.with a frown, i open my bedroom door.sure enough, there's nate, lying on the carpet just outside his own room.i hesitate, realizing i'm wearing my little nightgown, but figure he's seen me in it already."nate?are you ok?what happened?"i murmur, hurrying to kneel next to him.the whiff of alcohol coming off of him gives it away before he says anything."i'm so drunk, brynn," he says, beginning to laugh."shhh, you'll wake up our parents," i admonish him."why are you on the floor?""tripped.on my own foot," he replies with a sigh."well, come on, get up," i order him, sliding a hand under his torso to pull him upward.he slowly obeys and stands on his feet, where he sways dangerously."ok, now in here," i continue, pushing his bedroom door open with my foot as i slide an arm around his back to stabilize him.i feel his muscles clench under his t-shirt as we walk.not the time, brynn."shoes off," i order him as we reach the bed."mmm," he grunts, as he kicks them off."i'm getting you some water.don't move."i hurry back to my bedroom and grab my water glass from the bedside table, then refill it from the tap in my bathroom before heading back to his room.i shut the door behind me to keep the noise from filtering around the house, then stop in surprise as i see that nate has stripped down to his boxers and is standing at the foot of his bed."thanks," he slurs, as i hesitantly walk forward and hand him the water.i watch him gulp the whole glass down, the grey moonlight from the window illuminating his ripped torso.he puts the glass down on his desk and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand as he sways slightly."you alright?"i ask worriedly."i've never seen you drunk before.""don't really drink.no time.work, practice, work, game.""and i thought i was the nerd," i tease him."you're funny," he says, cocking his head slightly, then takes a step toward me."nate..." i say as my core clenches."yes, brynn?"he asks innocently."you said this was wrong.those were your words," i remind him."do you think it's wrong?"he takes another step toward me, and looks down at me."i-" his hand reaches around my waist."does it feel wrong?""yes... no," i breathe.i barely have time to inhale before his mouth is on mine.his mouth tastes like whiskey, but i don't care.i wrap my hands around his neck and he grabs my ass with both hands, our kiss picking up right where our last one broke off.i dig my fingers into his hair as our mouths open to one another.he pulls me roughly against him and groans deep in his throat as our bodies collide.suddenly he stumbles back, steadying himself on my shoulders."sorry," he whispers, shaking his head as though to clear it."will you just stay with me for a while?""yes, of course," i reply immediately, even though i'm taken aback by his request.i watch him turn to his bed and crawl over to his pillow, then curl up on his side and look at me expectantly.i pause, then follow him, crawling across the bedspread and curling around his back.i bury my head between his shoulder blades then drape my arm over his waist, and feel him take my hand in his and pull me closer against him.i lie as still as i can, barely breathing.i can't believe he's letting me touch him like this.well, he is wasted, but still.i never thought he'd be so vulnerable around me.i hear his breathing deepen."i've always looked up to him," he murmurs, startling me."i know," i whisper back, knowing that he's talking about his dad."i don't know what i would do if he-" "i know," i murmur, softly kissing the back of his neck.he stills on his pillow, and his breathing slows down again.i stay with him for a while, until i know he's asleep.i need to understand nate's feelings about his mother before i tell him what she told me.his world is already falling apart around him, and i don't want to make it happen faster.i sigh.i should probably go back to my room.i turn over with a sigh and frown.my sheets feel different, and the light coming in from the window is much too bright.i blink my eyes open and then sit up with a gasp.i'm in nate's room."it's ok." i glance up to see nate sitting at his desk with a glass of water, his tousled hair sticking out at odd angles."they left early this morning for meetings.your door is closed, so they thought you were still asleep in there.""oh, good," i reply.i realize my nightgown is riding dangerously high on my thigh and pull up the sheet self-consciously."coffee," nate says, pointing to the bedside table next to me.i glance over and see he's placed a steaming cup there."cream and one sugar, right?""yeah, thanks," i reply, reaching for it."sorry about last night.i don't remember anything after i got home."i smile even though i'm disappointed that he doesn't remember the kiss."you were drunk, and just asked me to stay here for a bit.i didn't mean to fall asleep."i glance at the clock."shit, it's almost eleven?i never sleep that late.""i didn't get up'til nine-that's late for me."my mind quickly returns to my concerns from last night."i-i know you don't like to talk about this, but your mom-" "what about her?"he says, already sounding defensive.i need to tread carefully."i know that it's painful to talk about, i just wanted to know : why did she leave?"nate crosses his arms over his chest."eileen left because she couldn't handle being a mother.""what do you mean?how so?""i was out of control when i was a kid, and she couldn't handle it.couldn't handle me.""that's what your dad told you.""that's what happened," nate replies, frowning at me."i still remember the night she left.they went out for dinner, and i stayed home with a babysitter.one of many, because i kept driving them away, and i misbehaved again.i threw a tantrum, broke a glass... i'm pretty sure the babysitter quit as soon as my parents got home.anyway, they got in this big fight-i could hear it even in my bedroom-and the next day she left.""and you've never seen her again?""in court a couple times.but after that, she wasn't really interested in seeing me.she tries to call here sometimes, maybe she feels guilty.she always tries to blame my dad for what went down," he adds bitterly."did you think that if... if you had been better, she wouldn't have left?"he shrugs."doesn't matter now.why are you asking about this stuff?did i talk about it when i was drunk or something?""no, no."i put my coffee down on the nightstand."she called here last night.""eileen?you talked to her?""well, yeah, she was really upset.""fuck, brynn," he swears, standing up."why would you do that?this has nothing to do with you.""i was just trying to help..." "i don't need your help," he spits at me."would you just listen for a second?!she called because she thought you might be willing to listen to her after what the woman said on the tv show-" "what are you talking about?"he growls."she said your dad was cheating on her, that's why she left.nothing to do with you.""get out," he says, raising his voice and pointing to the door."nate, my dad left, too, ok?i know what it's like.but she sounded so lost, she's desperate to talk to you.i'd kill for my dad to sound like that about me.""oh, so that's what this is about, your daddy issues.""no!that's not what i meant," i plead, his words stinging to my core."look, i'm sorry that your dad isn't around, but your whole situation has nothing to do with mine!""fine!"i shout, feeling hurt.i push off the sheets and stand up."i promised her i'd tell you, so i did.i'll never try to help you again.""that's all i ask!"he calls after me as i stomp out of his room.i slam my bedroom door behind me, my fists balled in anger.i walk straight to my bed and grab my pillow and swing it down as hard as i can onto the mattress.i.can't.believe.i.ever.had.feelings.for.that.asshole.i think as i bring the pillow down again and again until i'm out of breath.it's officially time for me to move on.chapter fifteen "you look nice," my mom says as i enter the kitchen, giving me a wink."mom..." i reply, rolling my eyes."well, you do!where are you two going tonight?""la mirabelle.""french-how romantic!""it's just a first date, ok?don't get too excited."i turn as nate and pierce enter from the dining room."i just have a good feeling about this one, that's all."she continues, pouring me a glass of water, "and he's picking you up, right?""oh, do you have a date tonight, brynn?"pierce asks, wiggling his eyebrows at my mother."yes," i groan, not wanting to make a big deal out of it."greg!the intern from your office," my mom tells him."well, well.you know, i remember seeing you two huddled together in the copy room last week, and thinking to myself,'those two would make a fine couple."'i blush as my mom smiles enthusiastically.it's amazing how quickly things have gotten back to normal after that woman went on tv.for about a week, a handful of photographers waited around outside the gate, but they eventually left when the buzz died down.pierce told us he has investigators working to discredit the woman's claims, and that everything will be back to normal.as for nate and me... "so it'll just be the three of us for dinner then," my mom chirps."two, actually.i'm going out tonight, as well," nate replies casually.i manage to resist the urge to look at him."oh?"my mom asks."nate, you should've let holly know about your plans.how many times have i had this conversation with you?responsibility, responsibility, responsibility," pierce says as he crosses to the fridge.i glance at my mom, but she's looking down at her chopping board."sorry, holly," nate says dutifully."it's alright, really," my mom says quietly.thankfully, the doorbell rings and i can excuse myself.angry as i am at nate, i still don't like to hear his dad speak to him in such a condescending way.i walk down the hallway to the foyer, and hear my mom and pierce following me.i wince.i was hoping i'd get out the door without them all meeting-wishful thinking, clearly.i smile at greg as i open the door.he's wearing a navy blazer and khakis, and looks a little nervous."hey, greg," i greet him."greg!it's so nice to meet you," my mom says from behind me, forcing me to open the door all the way."good to see you," pierce says, shaking his hand."mr. thornhill," greg replies formally.i see nate appear in the entrance to the living room, leaning casually on the doorjamb but saying nothing.he smiles at me as i catch his eye.i frown at him and look away."have her home by ten," pierce instructs greg."yes, sir," greg replies.pierce slaps him on the back just as i'm about to protest."don't worry, greg, i'm just giving you a hard time.""oh, you had me for a second there," greg says, exhaling in relief."well, we should get going," i cut in so that pierce doesn't have the chance to make any more hilarious jokes."see you later!"i call, pulling the door closed behind me.i just catch nate's smirking expression before i shut the door."you alright?"greg asks as we walk to his car.i force a smile and nod my head."yes, sorry!my mind wandered for a second.so, have you ever been to this restaurant before?"greg chose a very nice french restaurant for our date, it's a cozy, softly lit place set in the hills of potomac.the wait staff is clearly passionate about their food, and delighted to have a young couple on a date that they can fawn over."so, how is it working for your stepdad?"greg asks with a grin."you know, it's not that bad.i hardly ever think twice about it, really.he's all the way at the top of the company, and i'm all the way at the bottom, so we rarely interact on a day-to-day basis.""speaking of being at the bottom, roderick called me steven yesterday," greg says, referencing pierce's business partner.i laugh."no!is there even a steven working there?""nope!that's the worst part.who knows who he was thinking of..." he shakes his head remorsefully."how come pierce's son isn't working at thornhill and co.?didn't want to work with his dad?""um, the opposite, actually.pierce is pretty hard on nate... i feel kind of guilty about the whole thing because i think nate wanted the internship, and then pierce offered it to me to punish him.i tried not to accept, but pierce insisted, and we'd just met, you know?i didn't want to be rude.not to mention, my mom and pierce haven't known each other for very long, so i was a little taken aback by how quickly they'd gotten married..." i bite my lip."sorry, wow.i'm rambling.""it's ok, i get it.my parents are divorced, too.""well, mine aren't actually divorced.they weren't married in the first place," i clarify.but greg isn't listening-he's squinting at the entrance to the restaurant."speaking of... isn't that nate now?did you tell him we were coming here?""no, what?it can't be him," i reply, turning around to look.but sure enough, there he is, with a brunette stunner on his arm.that asshole!there's no way this is a coincidence-he must have overheard me telling my mom that greg was taking me here."brynn!"nate says with a smile, leading his date over as the hostess trails them."i didn't know you guys were coming here too!greg, right?i'm nate.""good to meet you," greg says, shaking his outstretched hand."and this is sophie," nate adds, indicating his date."hey," she says, glancing up for a moment from the cellphone in her hands."did you all want to sit together?"the hostess asks."we could pull another table over."i could kill her."what do you think?"nate asks greg, his grin at full-wattage."um, yeah, sure, why not?"greg complies.i quickly stand and make my way over to greg as a waiter helps the hostess pull another small table over.i'm not going to sit next to nate and risk a repeat of that thigh-touching incident."i'll let you two sit next to each other," i explain with a saccharine smile as i take a seat next to greg."we just ordered so you're not too far behind," greg says as the hostess hands nate and sophie menus."could we get a bottle of dom for the table?"nate asks the waiter, who nods happily and scurries off."oh, you don't have to-" greg begins."no, i insist.we're interrupting your date here," nate replies magnanimously."i love champagne," sophie pipes up, finally putting her phone away.i narrow my eyes at nate and he studiously avoids my gaze."so, what were you two lovebirds talking about before we got here?"nate asks greg."nothing, really," greg replies glancing at me."you know, with your light hair, you two could almost be related.cousins, maybe," nate observes, leaning back in his chair.i swiftly kick his shin under the table.i see his jaw tighten but he doesn't even make a sound."oh my god, totally!"sophie agrees."i made out with my cousin once, but i didn't know he was my cousin at the time.but then it happened again..." i glare at nate as sophie launches into her story, and he smiles back at me.it's going to be a long night.chapter sixteen i spin around in nate's desk chair as he shuts his bedroom door behind him.i've been waiting here, fuming, ever since greg dropped me off twenty minutes ago."jesus!what are you, a bond villain?"he asks, genuinely startled."what were you thinking?!i know you did that on purpose to ruin my date, you fucker!"nate shrugs."come on, you really going to tell me you were having a great time before i got there?""oh, so you were just helping me out, is that it?greg was completely weirded out by the whole thing.""sophie had a nice time.""sophie, please!where'd you find her?a high school dance?""i like her," he says with a smug grin as he sits on his bed."oh, really?so why aren't you with her right now?couldn't seal the deal?"his smile falters a bit."maybe i didn't feel like it.""well, i guess there's a first time for everything.just stay out of my life, ok?"i say, and stalk toward the door."i'll stay out of yours if you stay out of mine," he counters.i turn to face him, "is that what this is about?you're mad because i told you your mom called, so you try to ruin my date?"i hold out my hands in surrender."no, it wasn't that.""then what?i don't have time to play games with a crazy man-child.""i'm sorry, alright?i just didn't like seeing you with that guy... something about his face is just, so punch-able," he says, standing up and walking over to me."why?this is the second time you've come between me and a guy."i hold up a hand to stop him from protesting."and yeah, i know, jackson wasn't a good choice, but that's not the case with greg, ok?he's a nice guy.so tell me, why do you care?"i challenge him as he looks down at me.there's a long pause as his pupils dilate, i can practically feel him struggling with the truth, but i refuse to move until he admits it."you know why," he says, looking me in the eye, his voice low and husky.before i know what's happening, his arms are around me, pulling me against him.his urgency takes my breath away-his fingers reach desperately under my shirt, grabbing at my bra strap and expertly undoing the clasps.his mouth devours mine as he reaches back around my waist and picks me up effortlessly, bringing me over to his bed.as nate puts me down, i realize my bra is hanging free in the back, and he breaks away from our kiss to rip off my top.he pauses to look down at my breasts curving out of my limp bra before diving into my neck."oh god, brynn, i have to have you," he groans.i gasp as he sinks his teeth into my skin and then flicks his tongue across my taut neck muscles on his way up to my ear.my knees buckle as his tongue presses into my ear, and i grab onto his neck for support.my mind can't keep up with what's happening, all my thoughts are a blur, but my body is urging me on, desperately.as he sucks on my earlobe, i slide my hands down and under his shirt, finally feeling the body i've coveted for so long.his abs are even harder than i thought they would be, and they flex under my soft fingertips.i keep sliding my hands upward, feeling his nipples harden under my palms, and i feel the growing bulge of his cock pressing against my thigh...i turn nate thornhill on.holy fuck.the thought drives me crazy and i feel myself instantly become moist with wanting, my body overcome with illicit, sinful lust.no man has ever made me feel this way before.he steps back for a moment and pulls off his shirt, tossing it carelessly on the ground, revealing his incredible body for all its glory.thousands of hours spent at the gym on and on the field have painstakingly sculpted his muscles into a fucking masterpiece for womankind.he slowly reaches forward and takes my bra straps under his expert fingers, pulling them off my arms and tossing my bra onto the pile of clothes on the floor.i shiver involuntarily as he looks down my exposed body, exhaling softly out of his mouth.he sinks to his knees in front of me and leans forward, kissing me gently on my stomach.i place my hands on his shoulders as he moves up, running his tongue underneath the crease of my breasts.i cry out as he takes my right breast into his mouth, sucking hard on my nipple.he brings one hand up to massage my left breast, and i dip my head back, feeling pleasure swell in my body like i never have before.i feel his fingers hook over the top of my skirt and slowly pull it down as his mouth moves to my left breast, softly biting it before flicking his tongue back and forth across my areola.i hear my skirt fall to the floor and his hands glide up my legs from my knees, his thumbs hooking around my inner thigh.he dips his head and kisses me softly just above the top of my white cotton underwear."i've been dreaming about how sweet you taste," he murmurs, almost inaudibly.he pulls my panties down just a bit and runs his tongue over the now exposed skin.i begin to shake, a mixture of unbridled desire and nerves, as he slides my underwear down to my ankles.i feel his warm breath on my skin, just a moment before his mouth is on me, kissing and licking my most intimate of places.i moan involuntarily at the sensation... it's completely new to me, and it feels better than i ever could have imagined.he flicks his tongue across my aching clit, sending jolts of rapture through every inch of me.with one hand i tighten my grip on his strong shoulders, digging my fingers into his hair with the other, and letting my head dip back in utter bliss as he licks my pussy with slow, strong strokes."oh my god, nate..." i hear myself moan from far away as i'm carried off by wave after wave of pleasure.before i know what's happening, my body spasms, and i feel nate grab my ass to keep me upright and pressed against his skillful mouth.as i begin to come down, i feel his licks becoming gentler.he reaches up and puts his finger to my lips, and i instinctively take it into my mouth, licking and sucking his finger, thinking about how incredible it would feel to do this to another part of him...he pulls his finger out of my mouth and slips it carefully inside my tight pussy.he circles it around slowly, and i can hear him grunt in satisfaction at my wetness.my eyes begin to open slowly and i glance down at him.he catches my eye and stands up, dipping his head down and catching me in a kiss, his finger still inside me.my eyes widen as i taste myself on his lips and he pushes his tongue inside me with abandon."i'm going to make you feel so fucking good," he promises with a wicked smile, undoing his belt buckle and unzipping his pants in one fluid motion before pushing them and his boxers to the ground.i gape at his massive cock as it's unsheathed from his underwear.its size snaps me back to the reality of what's about to happen, and i feel overcome with fear and adrenalin... but i can't take my eyes off it.i want to feel him inside of me so much, but i think there's one thing i need to tell him first.he bites his lip and moves against me again.i can feel his cock, throbbing and ready, against my stomach.he wraps his arms around me, and eases me back onto the bed and lays on top of me, kissing my neck."nate... i... i have to tell you..." i murmur, his mouth a complete distraction."mmm, whatever it is, it doesn't matter now," he replies, biting my earlobe."it might, though.i just thought i should tell you, or warn you maybe, in case i'm not very good-" "i doubt that-" "i'm a virgin."i feel his body stiffen as the words cross my lips.he pulls back and looks me in the eye."what?no.no way."i nod."but it's ok.i want to do this.""how... how are you a virgin?"oh, dear.this is not the kind of conversation i want to have right now."i don't know, i just am.it just hasn't happened yet, but i'm ready now."i assure him."but you've... you must have done some things..." he begins worriedly."yeah, sure, you know, kissing..." "and?wait, was that the first time anyone's ever gone down on you?"i can only shrug."i didn't think it would be that big of a deal.i just was telling you, in case i'm not that good, or if i bleed or something."he rolls off of me and sits up.shit."brynn, it is a big deal, it's a very big deal to me.""i don't understand..." i reply, sitting up and pulling the sheet over to cover me, suddenly feeling very self-conscious."it's just, your first time... it's going to mean a lot to you.""so?"i say, confused.he spreads his hands open on his legs but doesn't say anything.i feel a sensation like a rock sinking to the bottom of my stomach."oh... you're saying it will mean a lot to me, but it won't mean a lot to you."i stare straight forward as he turns to me."brynn, you're smart, gorgeous, funny, ambitious... you're wonderful... but like i told you before, i don't lie to women and say that i'm interested in something more when i'm not.""i guess i forgot about your policy," i reply flatly, feeling like the biggest idiot in the world.the biggest naked idiot in the world."could you... could you close your eyes?""brynn, i've seen-" "just close them, ok?"i glance at him to make sure he's complied, and then stand up and begin to gather my clothes from the floor.i slip everything back on as quickly as i can, and then look back at him.his eyes are closed, and he's sitting nude and perfectly still on the edge of the bed.he looks as perfect as i've ever seen him look, which is really saying something.my heart breaks a little, as i move to the door and shut it behind me.i hurry down the hall and into my own bedroom, which now feels cold and empty.i crawl into bed without bothering to take off my clothes and pull the covers over me.i'm no different to nate thornhill than any of the other girls he's been with, and i should have known that.stupid, stupid, stupid.i hear a soft knock at the door and pull the covers up a little higher, but don't answer.if it's my mom, i don't want to see her, and if it's nate, i really don't want to see him.there's another knock, a little louder, and then the door is slowly pushed open.i can just see nate's shadow in the moonlight.he closes the door behind him and moves into the room.to my surprise, he walks around the foot of my bed and to the other side, then hops on, lying down over the covers next to me."i'm sorry," he whispers, laying his hands over his stomach."you don't have to apologize.you were just being honest.""no, i think i do.and i'll stop interfering with you and other guys."i clear my throat to keep the pain down."good.""i don't really have female friends..." he says."dana?""dana and i are, well, fuck buddies, mostly.and that's what she wants, too, so it's ok." "mmm.""but i'd... I'd like us to be friends.""we're already step-siblings," i point out.i can hear him smile next to me."true.but that wasn't by choice."he pauses."i like you.i can't deny that i'm attracted to you, of course, but i'm just not the relationship kind of guy.not to mention the kind of issues that dating my own stepsister would bring up."he sighs."so can we be friends?"i consider for a moment.if i'm nate's only female friend, then i really am different to him.maybe not in the way i'd most like, but still, it's something."ok. friends, then.wait, actually," i turn onto my side and face him."before we're officially friends, i have to ask you some non-friend questions.""ok..." he replies warily, turning on his side, too."was i... am i... ok at all that stuff?you know..." he laughs."what we just did, you mean?yes.you are more than ok at it."i smile."when did you lose your virginity?""when i was fourteen.""wow.""she was my friend's older sister.""wow.""how many women have you slept with?""oh my god, i don't even know..." "wait, really?you don't even know?""i mean, dozens?i don't count.""sheesh.ok, one more : why aren't you the relationship kind of guy?"he pauses."i don't know," he says softly."i tried a couple times, but that kind of closeness, it just makes me uncomfortable.that's all i know."i nod, sensing he's telling me everything he can, and roll back over onto my back.i like the feeling of lying here with him next to me.i feel much more comfortable than i would have thought possible.i feel my eyes beginning to flutter closed as sleep pulls me under."brynn... i..."i can just hear nate say."you're going to make some man very happy one day."chapter seventeen "i'm just glad the whole thing has blown over," greg says as we pull off the beltway.i nod as i look out at the trees whizzing by in the dark.the woman who accused pierce of sexual harassment rescinded her claims after it turned out she had accused two other former bosses of the same thing."it just feels like there's been a shadow over the office for the last month.""yeah," i reply noncommittally.greg clears his throat as we near my house."so, i'm glad we got the chance to go out again," he says."me too," i reply with a smile.this is our third date, and he still hasn't tried anything.i'm wondering if tonight will be the night.a nervous silence falls over the car as we pull through the gates and onto the driveway.he stops in front of the house and then turns to me."why don't i walk you to your door," he suggests."sure."a few butterflies begin to fly around in my stomach.we undo our seat belts and hop out, meeting around the front of the car and walking up to the front door.i glance at him out of the corner of my eye and wish there were something calming i could say to him, because he looks way more nervous than i do.we reach the door and turn to each other."well, goodnight," he says."goodnight."he pauses, looking into my eyes, and then begins to move forward.i lean in, and close my eyes.his lips touch mine and i frown slightly.i mean, there's nothing wrong with his lips or anything, but i thought i'd feel... more.he keeps his mouth chastely pressed against mine for a few seconds and then pulls back and smiles at me."goodnight, brynn," he says again."goodnight," i reply, and turn to go inside.i shut the door behind me, and lean back against it, disappointed.greg and i get along well, and he's such a nice guy-i'd hoped i would eventually develop romantic feelings for him... but that kiss... was not so good.i sigh and continue through the foyer and into the kitchen."hey," nate greets me.i stop as a buzz runs through me at just the sight of him.that's the feeling i can't manufacture when i'm with greg."hey.you go for a run?"i ask, taking in his sweaty appearance."yeah, well, just on the treadmill.too dark for a trail run.did you... did you have a nice time tonight?"i glance over at him.he gulps a long sip from a gatorade bottle and then puts it down on the counter."um, yeah, it was good," i reply."i was just going to watch a movie in the den if you're interested.""fine, but i choose tonight," i reply with a smile.we've both committed to this whole being friends thing, though at times i feel like i'm going through the motions.i don't know if i'll ever be able to turn off the part of me that will always want more from him."no romantic comedies," he says, as he walks to the door of the kitchen."i'm just going to hop in the shower really fast."the phone on the counter rings and he steps toward it, but it only rings once.we both look toward pierce's study as raised voices emanate from that direction.a moment later, we hear stomping coming our way and frown at each other in concern.pierce storms in and walks to the fridge."reporter?"nate asks quietly."your mother," pierce replies, equally quietly, though there's a hint of venom in his voice.my eyes flick over to nate.i hope i haven't made the situation worse by taking her call that one time.he meets my gaze and shakes his head quickly as though to warn me not to say anything."i don't know how she got this new number-it's unlisted.that bitch just won't give up."my mouth drops open at pierce's language.i've never even heard him swear before, and it's so at odds with his genteel appearance that it sounds even more shocking coming out of his mouth."we're going to go watch a movie," i murmur, wanting to get away from him when he's in this kind of mood.i can feel the waves of anger coming off of him.but pierce swings around to face nate, the gatorade bottle in his hand."how many fucking times have i told you to clean up after yourself?"he growls, and i shrink back."i wasn't done drinking-" nate begins."don't interrupt me!you think the rest of the world is just here to serve you?that everyone else exists to make your cushy life a little easier?you've never had to work for anything in your life.it's pathetic," pierce spits at his son.i remain frozen on the other side of the counter, feeling like a coward, and not knowing what i should say.i see color rise in nate's cheeks, but all he says is, "yes, sir."with that, pierce slams the bottle back on the counter and walks back toward his office without even looking at me.nate remains motionless for a moment, then walks over to the bottle, drinks the rest of it, and tosses it into the recycling."i'm sorry, you didn't deserve-" i start, feeling horrified by the scene i just witnessed."you still want to watch that movie?"nate asks, tilting his head toward me but not making eye contact."yes," i whisper back, unsure of what else to do or say."ok, meet you in there in ten minutes," nate says simply and walks out.i wait until i can hear him walking up the stairs before i move.i've never heard a father talk to his son like that before, and our old neighborhood wasn't exactly full of model families.and the way nate's shoulders slumped as pierce was speaking to him, it was like he agreed with what his father was saying about him.i walk up the stairs to my room and change into my sweats, before heading back downstairs to make some popcorn-food always makes me feel better.as soon as it's finished popping, i head into the den to wait for nate.should i tell my mom about what pierce just did?would she even listen?she seems to have drunk the pierce kool-aid pretty heavily by this point.and now that pierce has been the victim of false allegations, it will be even harder for her to believe anything bad about him.i glance up, frowning, as nate walks in and sits down on the couch next to me."i can tell by that expression on your face that you want to talk," he begins.i smile slightly, he knows me well."but the stuff with my parents-it's off-limits, ok?"but i need to tell him that those things pierce said aren't true."just-" "no, brynn.i really want us to be able to keep hanging out.but if you keep bringing it up..." i sigh."fine.i won't say anything.in exchange, though..." i walk to the wide bookcases full of dvd options."no romantic comedies!""big fish," i say, pulling out the case."is that a romantic comedy?"he asks, narrowing his eyes suspiciously."well, not really.there is romance in it, but it's more about a family," i explain, careful not to mention the predominant father-son themes."hey, friendships have to have some compromise," i add with a smile."ok, fine," he says, rolling his eyes.he takes a handful of popcorn and leans against one end of the couch as i pop the dvd in.as i make myself comfortable on the other end, he pulls a blanket from the back of the couch and arranges it over my feet, because he knows that they get cold.i feel a pang in my chest at the small gesture, but try to push it away.he's not being romantic, just thoughtful.i look up at the large tv screen as the picture comes up.i feel more comfortable around nate than i do with anyone else in my life right now, so i have to settle for being friends with him.otherwise i could lose him altogether.chapter eighteen "you and nate head down there so we don't lose the reservation!"my mom instructs me.she planned a family outing to go rafting on the potomac, but pierce is stuck at the office in meetings, even though it's a saturday."i'll swing by and get him and meet you there.""you sure?""yeah, he said he'd only be a little longer," she assures me."ok," i reply with a shrug, and walk into the anteroom off the kitchen where nate is slipping on his sneakers."my mom says they're going to meet us there," i tell him."fuck it, let's make tracks, sis."he smirks.and off we go in his wrangler, nate blasting some god-awful metal music."how do you listen to this shit?it sounds like two cat's screwing in a trashcan."i shake my head."what?this is slayer, they're classic trash metal, you have to have respect."he says reverently."i always listen to reign in blood before all of my games.""lovely."i screw my face up in mock horror.he turns it up louder, nodding his head enthusiastically as the guitar riffs collide into what i assume is his favorite part of the song.it's strange to see him let loose like this, and even though i think his taste in music is horrifying, i have to admit i like to see him enjoying himself.thankfully, the boathouse is just a little ways down the potomac in the direction of the city, and i'm only subjected to slayer for a few more minutes.the temperature on this august day is in the mid-nineties, but my mom was insistent upon doing a family activity outdoors.as we take a left on the dirt road with an old sign pointing the way, i spot an empty parking lot, and figure most people are wisely staying inside with their air-conditioning today.after we park, nate heads over to the wood-slatted structure to secure the boat, and i take the sunscreen out of my bag.as nate walks back over, he smiles as he sees me struggling to smear it in between the straps of my sports bra."want some help?'he asks."... sure," i reply, though i'm anything but.the idea of nate's hands on me, when i know nothing else is going to happen, sounds like torture.i might actually prefer getting a first-degree sunburn, but he's already taken the bottle from me and squeezing some of it out into his palm."um, just pull the back of your shirt up," he instructs me.i do as he says, pulling it up to my hairline.i feel his greased-up hands slipping under the straps of my bra, and am glad he can't see the blush that immediately spreads across my face.i take a deep breath, trying to keep my raging hormones at bay, as his fingers slide around the side of my ribcage."now you do me," he says, as i release my shirt."that's what she said," i mutter."ha!"nate barks, a short, joyful shout of laughter."i didn't know you were funny brynn," he says, grinning wide at me."there's a lot you don't know about me."i say, daring to meet his gaze for a brief moment.i clear my throat and take the bottle of sunscreen from him, willing myself to keep my thoughts clean.he pauses, then turns around and pulls off his shirt.i groan inwardly at the sight of his wide, muscular back.where are our parents?i need some kind of buffer between us.but there are no signs of any cars pulling into the parking lot anytime soon, so i dutifully squeeze some lotion onto my fingers and then begin to spread it across his back.i carefully press it all the way up to his neck, across his shoulder blades-feeling the sinewy ropes of muscle there, down his back, and finally down to the top of his athletic shorts, my fingers venturing just inside his waistband.i hear him suck in a small bit of air, and see the slight throbbing of his member in his shorts.he's trying hard to hold back, i can tell."ok, all done!"i say overly cheerily, as i hand him the bottle.nate tosses his shirt into the back of his jeep and begins to spread sunscreen across his chest.i keep my eyes trained on the hazy river."they say how long they were going to be?""nope, my mom just said-" i break off as i hear my phone start to ring in my purse on the front seat."i bet that's her now.hey, mom," i greet her as i accept the call."hey, honey.""what's wrong?"i ask, immediately hearing stress in her voice."oh, it's nothing, but pierce won't be able to get out of the office long enough to go kayaking today.i'm just going to drive down to the office now, so at least he and i can have lunch together.""ok, should we-" "no, you two go kayaking and have fun, alright?we'll see you tonight for dinner.""oh, alright, if you're sure," i reply, wincing as i catch nate watching me, his muscular torso gleaming in the sun."your dad got caught up in work stuff, and my mom's going to go meet him at the office for lunch, so they're not coming.they said we should still go if we want," i explain as i hang up."since we're here," nate says with a shrug."you ever been kayaking here before?""never been kayaking at all.""well, you'll love it," he replies, locking up his car."says the captain of the uva crew team."i smile.in short order, we're pushing off the dock in a tandem kayak.with nate's powerful oar strokes, we quickly clear the shallow, muddy water and head toward the open water."you'll get the hang of it," nate encourages me, and i turn around to smile sheepishly at him."i think i'm just holding you back, here," i laugh, trying to get the feeling of how to dip the oar in the water at the right time."well, i have a lot more experience than you in a boat," he says."we used to train for crew on the potomac in high school, but we were a lot closer in to the city.we'd pass georgetown, the kennedy center... you'd be amazed at the wildlife you can see out here, though," he tells me as he steers us upriver and into the current."i feel so far away from everything," i observe as the sounds of traffic are quickly covered up by the trees rising on either side of us."this land used to belong to a native american tribe called the-" "piscataway," i finish reflexively."damn, i keep forgetting my stepsister is a nerd," he says, and i can hear from his voice that he's grinning."i won't even try to impress you with my passion for local history, then.""no, come on, impress me," i tease him."i can't hold a candle," he feigns defeat."you get better grades than me.""yeah, well, put me on two varsity teams and i think those grades might dip a little.i don't know how you do it.my friends allison and miriam tell me i spend too much time at the library-i barely have enough time for them.not to mention, i'm not athletically gifted at all," i add, nodding to my ineffectual rowing."so you've got me there.""i met allison on the 4th, right?""right.""but miriam?""she's back home in memphis for the summer.she's my other good friend; she and allison room together.""why don't you live with them?"he asks, and i pause to listen to his oars dropping quietly into the water."mm, i thought about it, but i like living alone.my mom can be..." "what?"he prods me."i'm trying to think of a more flattering word for needy.""you can say needy if you want.i won't tell.""ok, she's really fucking needy," i reply, feeling like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.i hardly ever talk about the more negative aspects of my relationship with my mom."honestly, a lot less so since she's met pierce, though.sometimes i just feel like i'm-" "her mom," he finishes for me.i turn to face him, raising my eyebrows."is it obvious?"i ask worriedly."i don't mean to sound resentful.""you're allowed to feel however you want about her," he responds with a kind smile, and i turn back around."at first i thought you were fragile," he says after a moment."like if i dropped you, you'd break.i think that's why... that's why i wanted to test you a little.""you mean when you felt me up at dinner with our parents sitting across from us?"he laughs."i can't believe i did that, and i don't think i've ever apologized.""no, you didn't, jerk.""i am sorry.""so, you don't think i'm fragile now?""no.i think you're one of the toughest people i've ever met.look!"he says suddenly.i glance back toward him and follow where's he's pointing."a great blue heron," he explains as i spot the huge bird with its wings spread, perched on a rock in the middle of the river."that's how they dry their feathers after they dive for fish."he stops rowing for a while as we watch it.suddenly it pulls its wings in, gathers itself like a coil, and launches into the air.we watch it fly into the distant treetops before we begin paddling up the river again."why are you interested in history?"i ask him."i like understanding why people behave the way they do," he explains quietly.i resist the urge to ask how this relates to his own history, trying to respect the boundaries he's put up."how's greg?"he asks suddenly.i turn around and narrow my eyes at him."what?that's a friendly question," he says with a devilish grin."i... i don't want to talk about it," i reply, a little more huffily than i intend to."ok... so that either means really good or really bad.""it's not really bad," i protest."uh-oh."i sigh."it's just, there's no... you know..." "spark?""exactly.i have to tell him soon-i don't want him to get hurt.not that i think i'm breaking his heart or anything-" "i saw the way he looks at you.""meaning?""he's falling fast.i'd tell him before he falls any further.""i think you're exaggerating.""trust me."we fall back into a comfortable silence as i think about his words.the stillness of the river, broken only by a soft wind blowing through the trees, helps to ease my anxiety over the conversation i need to have with greg.the concept of "problems" seems to fade out here, though perhaps it's the unrelenting heat, which feels like it's beginning to melt my body into the seat of the kayak.i grab the sweating bottle of water from between my feet and take a long swig."water?"i ask nate, turning to offer it to him.he takes it, brushing my fingers with his as he wraps his long fingers around it.my insides clench... speaking of a spark.i spot a house very much like ours up on a hillside in the distance."where'd you live before the house now?""townhouse in georgetown."he says."it was less of a behemoth.had more character.""the mansion isn't your taste?""it was always big for two people, and it still seems big, even for four.but what i really don't like is that it's got all these fake historical touches about it, and none of them are genuine.""anathema to a history major.""exactly.i always pictured myself in a smaller house, maybe a converted barn or something... one that was actually built in the time period it looks like it was built in.maybe somewhere quieter than dc... it's pretty elitist here... i want my kids to grow up more modestly than i did.""you want kids?"i ask, surprised."you don't?""no, i do... i'm just surprised.you know that having kids might necessitate being in a relationship with a woman for longer than you're used to."he laughs."i honestly hadn't thought of that.i always just pictured myself with kids.is that horrible?""yes!"i reply, quickly reaching down and flinging water back at him."hey!"he cries, and grabs the sides of the kayak, beginning to rock it back and forth."i'll tip this thing over," he warns me with a grin."nate!"i protest, grabbing on.he relents, and keeps rowing after a moment."i think your mom picked the hottest day of the year," he observes."want to head back?"i ask, hoping he'll say no.he pauses."guess we should."i nod, feeling disappointed, and dip my oar in the water to help him turn the kayak.now that we're going with the current, it takes us much less time to make the return trip back to the boat house."how's your shoulder?"i ask."it's better, actually," he says happily, "thanks for asking."i feel a tightening in my throat as we pull into the shallower water.nate steps onto the dock first, then offers me his hand to help me get out of the unsteady boat."much shadier under the trees," he observes, nodding to a hiking trail that cuts through the trees behind the boat house.i look at him questioningly."short hike before we go back?"i nod and smile, trying not to look too pleased.chapter nineteen "you've got good stamina for someone who doesn't do sports," nate observes as our "short hike" goes into its second hour."i've been swimming in the pool pretty frequently, maybe that's it," i reply, though really i think it's that the conversation hasn't stopped.we're high over the potomac now, on a dirt trail that winds around large boulders.he was right-it is cooler under the trees, but it's still just as humid."is that it?"i ask, pointing to a three-leaved plant at the base of a tree.after telling nate that i manage to get poison ivy every other year, he's made it his mission to teach me how to identify the rash-causing the plant."not red enough.by this time of the summer, it'll be more red and oily-looking.and the edges of the leaves are too jagged," he says as he bends over to look at it.a pair of female hikers approach us on the trail, headed the opposite direction.i watch them drink in nate's shirtless, sweaty appearance and giggle to each other.as they pass, they smile flirtatiously at him, but he just politely smiles back before turning to me."you're good at so many things, but identifying plant species..." he intones in a mock-serious voice as he shakes his head."hey, if that's my weakness, i'll take it," i reply with a grin."yep, poison ivy, that's your kryptonite," he teases me."what's yours?intimacy?""intimacy?how dare you!it's commitment.very different.""oh, duh, of course.my apologies," i reply, glad we can joke about this kind of thing."wait, there!"i say, pointing to an ivy crawling up a tree trunk on the river side of the trail."where?i don't see it," nate replies, craning his neck."there!"i repeat, walking off the trail and into the underbrush."brynn, be careful!and i don't think that's poison ivy, anyway.""no, really!see, it's red-" i break off as i feel the ground beneath me give way.what i thought was solid earth was just an overhang of vegetation.my stomach flies into my throat as i begin to fall, the horizon instantly becoming a blur.i gasp and turn, frantically grabbing onto the dirt and branches nearby."brynn!"nate yells, and dives into the brush after me.i feel him grab my hand as i struggle to find a foothold on the steep hill beneath me.my feet frantically search for support and i begin to panic."it's ok, it's ok, i've got you," nate says.the steadiness in his voice causes me to look up at him.he's looking back down at me, his eyes sure and calm.i take a deep breath and reach my other hand up.he grabs it and begins to pull me up."under your right foot, there's a rock," he says, peering over the edge."don't look down, just feel for it.just an inch to your left.keep looking at me."the expression in his eyes arrests me, and i still for a moment, then slowly begin to move my foot to the left.there.i feel my sneaker knock against it, and move my foot up and onto it."ok, now just push off and i'll pull you up.one, two, three!"i shove my foot down and he kneels and pulls me up and back onto him.i land squarely on top of him, shaking with fear and adrenaline.i feel his arms reach around me and squeeze, almost pressing the last of the air out of me."fuck, brynn," he whispers in my ear."are you ok?"i reply, realizing he's landed on his back."am i ok?are you?"he says, sounding shocked."um, i think so, though it's hard to tell right now.""oh, sorry.here, stand up," he says, and i lean to the side of him.he jumps up then offers me both hands.i take them and stand, wincing as i put weight on my right foot."what's wrong?""my ankle, i think.""let's get back on the trail where i can look at it."he takes my arm and wraps it around his shoulder.i feel his arm around my waist and i'm practically lifted off my feet as he walks me back onto the trail.he guides me down to a seated position and i lean back on my hands as he gently picks up my right foot."it's a little swollen," he observes, "but i don't think it's broken-probably a bad sprain.think you're ok to walk back if i help you?""yeah, i'll be fine," i assure him.he helps me stand up and puts my arm around his shoulders.i take a deep breath as we take our awkward first steps back toward the boathouse, and i realize i'm in for a full hour of being pressed up against him."you're really sweaty, you know that?"i say with a smile."hey, you better be careful or i might lose my grip," he replies."how high up was i?""probably best not to think about it.""that's pretty high.""well, i'm glad you're alright... mostly."i don't know if it's the scare from almost falling, or if we're both just tired, but the slow walk back takes place in almost silence.i wish i could think of something to say to break the tension, but having his shirtless body pressed up against me is too much.i can feel our sweat mingling together and our breath syncing along with the rhythm of our footsteps.as we finally sight the parking lot, he stops and moves in front of me, then bends over, looking back at me expectantly.i laugh and lift my bad leg up onto him, and then jump up as he hoists me the rest of the way.he walks with me on his back until we reach the car, then deposits me right next to the passenger side door.as he jogs around to the driver's side, i turn to look around the parking lot.there are still only a few cars here, and in the corner is a blue sedan with a woman wearing sunglasses behind the wheel.i stare at her for a moment, because with her blonde hair, i thought for a moment that she was my mom.as we make eye contact she quickly looks away, and i hear the car start after a moment.maybe she was just staring at nate like the other women we encountered today.or maybe she's a reporter... pierce warned the family that there could still be a few hanging around."are you ok to get in by yourself?"nate asks, rolling down the window."oh, yeah, sorry," i reply, snapping back to attention.i open the door and use my left leg to hop into the elevated seat."everything alright?"he asks."yeah, it's fine."when we arrive back at the house, nate basket-carries me straight from the car into the kitchen, gently setting me down on a chair in the breakfast nook.he kneels in front of me and unlaces my shoe, then slips it off and peels my sock off."can you wiggle your toes?"i move them back and forth."and now really slowly move your whole foot around."i wince as i circle it and pain shoots up through my leg."i broke my ankle playing lacrosse my junior year, and i don't think that's what this is.let's ice and wrap it and see how it is tomorrow, or monday.if it's still bad, i'll take you to the doctor.""you know how to wrap it?""hey, when it's not my own hand, i'm pretty good at it."i watch him take down that same first aid kit from the cabinet and set it down on the floor as he kneels in front of me again.he carefully wraps athletic tape around my ankle and then around the middle of my foot, hooking it around and around until my ankle is firmly stabilized."ok, let's get you into the den so we can ice it."i begin to stand but he bends over and scoops me up again, carrying me through the hallways to the cozy den.he sets me down on the couch and then disappears.i grab a pillow and set it behind my back as i stretch my legs out, marveling at the sudden appearance of nate's caretaker instincts.he reappears with a ziploc bag of crushed ice and a glass of water, setting the latter down on the table next to me before lowering the ice down onto my ankle.i shiver as he places it down, and he pulls the throw down from the back of the couch.he grabs one end and unfolds it, then sits on the edge of the couch next to me to lay it over me, tucking the corners in around my body.i become very aware of my own breathing as he moves over me.i watch his hands as they take the edge of the blanket and tuck it around my shoulders.his right hand moves slowly from the blanket onto the exposed skin of my neck.i hold my breath as he lightly runs his fingertips up onto my jaw, then over to my chin.with his thumb and forefinger, he gently tilts my head up until i look at him.he's staring at my mouth, and only pauses for a moment before he bends down."please don't," i whisper as he's just inches away from kissing me."if you don't want anything more, it's just cruel.""what if i do want something more?"he says, his dark blue eyes flicking up to mine."more..." i repeat, rolling the word around my tongue."what kind of more?""i've never felt about someone the way i feel about you.i've tried fighting that feeling, i've tried reasoning with it, but it just keeps getting stronger.i have to give in-i need to.i can't tell you i know exactly what this will look like... i've never done anything like it.but i promise you that when i'm with you, i'll be with only you.and i want you to be with only me."i stare up at him.that's still a lot of unknowns, but i sense that he's giving me everything he can right now.plus my heart is about to beat out of my chest, and my resistance is giving out."only you," i nod, before reaching around his neck and pulling him toward me.our lips meet in an open kiss, our tongues finding each other's and mingling with desperate passion.he presses me back against the cushion, his hands grasping my waist over the blanket and quickly moving up and over my breasts.i arch my back into him, wanting to feel him against me... feel him everywhere."you guys home?"nate jumps away as we hear my mom's voice from the foyer.he takes a deep breath and then runs his hand through his hair before responding."we're in the den!"he calls back, then turns to me."tonight," he murmurs, his eyes burning with promise.chapter twenty "are you ok, brynn?"my mom asks me, frowning."yeah, i'm fine," i reply lightly as i use my napkin to try to clean the tomato sauce off my shirt where i've just spilled it.nate's promise of an evening rendezvous has left me clumsy and distracted throughout dinner.i had just finished cleaning up the glass of water i knocked off the table when i dropped a piece of chicken off my fork and onto my shirt."sorry i couldn't make it today, guys," pierce says."looks like you could have used some more supervision.nate shouldn't have taken you on any dangerous trails.""oh, it wasn't dangerous," i rush to nate's defense."he was trying to teach me how to spot poison ivy, actually, and i walked right off the trail.i didn't realize how close i was to the edge and the ground just gave way under me.it was all my fault.he was the one who pulled me back up and taped my ankle.""well, it couldn't hurt to get it looked at by a doctor on monday," my mom points out."i think it'll be fine, really," i insist."anyone want dessert?"my mom asks."no, thanks," nate and i both respond at the same time.i bite my lip to keep from laughing."what's so amusing?"pierce asks, looking at his son, his voice dangerously quiet."inside joke," i reply quickly."i'll help you clear the table, mom."we both stand and grab a couple plates and head into the kitchen.as soon as the swinging door shuts behind me, i hear pierce's voice.even though his words are muffled, i can tell by his tone that he's berating nate for something.i look at my mom.she turns on the water and begins rinsing off the plates before putting them into the dishwasher."is it ok with you that he talks to nate like that?""it's between the two of them," my mom replies quietly without looking up at me.i feel anger surge inside me."you keep trying to make us a family, but then you won't get involved in their relationship.you can't have it both ways."before she can reply, i spin back around and into the dining room.pierce breaks off abruptly as i enter the room, and i quickly clear the rest of the dishes before limping upstairs to my room.i take a deep breath as i close my bedroom door behind me.i don't want to have this night ruined by my anger at my mom and pierce.i head into the bathroom and turn on my shower.i still haven't had a chance to wash off the sweat from our kayaking and hiking trip today, and i want to smell like a rose tonight.my body tingles in anticipation as i peel off my shirt and shorts.i glance down at my wrapped ankle, wondering if it's ok to get wet.probably fine.i pull off my sports bra and underwear and then study myself in the mirror, running my hands over my breasts and then across my stomach.nate's already seen me naked, i remind myself, as nerves surge up in my stomach.and i already know he likes me.it will be ok.i step under the hot stream of water and take my time washing my hair.as the conditioner sets, i shave my legs and my bikini line, going a little bit narrower than i would normally.i know that a lot of girls at college go completely bare, but i can't bring myself to go that far.i turn off the water and towel myself off, then part my hair in the middle and let it air dry.i pull a pair of cotton pajama bottoms and a camisole from my bureau and put them on.i'm not sure if that's sexy or not, but i'm trying not to overthink it.i'm certainly not succeeding, but i am trying.i head over to my computer and sit down.i know that nate will probably wait for our parents to go to bed before he does anything, so i've got a couple of hours to go at least.i begin to click around the internet, but i'm not able to absorb myself in anything.i keep wondering what's going to happen tonight.i don't want to get my hopes up, but i think i have an idea.or at least, i know what i want to happen.i finally decide to play some mindless tv on hulu, and settle back in my chair."goodnight, brynn!"i finally hear my mom call as she heads up to the third floor.i freeze."goodnight!"i call back, and immediately begin pulling at the ends of my hair.i keep watching tv until i hear pierce heading upstairs, too, then quickly close my computer and hurry into the bathroom, wincing as i put too much weight on my right ankle.i run my fingers through my hair and decide i should brush my teeth.just as i'm putting my toothbrush back down, i hear a soft knock at my door.my heart jumps in my chest.i walk back into my bedroom just in time to see the door open and nate stick his head in."hi," i murmur."hi," he replies, taking a couple more steps in and closing the door behind him.i smile at him nervously.i suddenly have no idea what to say-the usual ease of conversation between us is replaced with jittery nerves and excitement.his appearance right now isn't helping matters.he's barefoot, and wearing jeans and a v-neck white t-shirt.he looks impossibly, effortlessly sexy."i can't remember the last time i was nervous with a woman," he finally says."oh, well... good.i'm nervous, too, i mean."he smiles and begins to walk slowly toward me."i want to do everything with you, brynn.the idea of being the first one to show you... everything..." he takes a deep breath."but i'm going to go slowly.you have to tell me if i'm ever moving too quickly, alright?it's going to be hard for me not to get caught up in the moment."i nod and realize that i've been holding my breath while he's been talking.he stops just in front of me and wraps his arms around my waist, then leans his head forward until his forehead rests against mine."come to bed," he whispers.a thrill of pleasure runs through me."you don't know how long i've wanted to hear you say that."he grins widely and presses his lips against mine.in contrast to our recent urgent caresses, this one is slow and gentle.perhaps because we know we're finally on the same page, and we have all night to spend with each other.his tongue delicately flicks against mine, and i feel his hands move under my ass and pick me up.he spins and walks to the bed, setting me down in a seated position on the edge."is there anything... in particular you want tonight?""i just want you," i reply with a shrug."well, that i can do."he grabs the bottom of his t-shirt and pulls it off over his head.i bite my lip.the tightness and size of his muscles always takes me aback.i lean forward and nuzzle my nose into the hair just under his belly button, then softly kiss him.i hear a low grunt from the back of his throat and lean back to look at him questioningly.he's looking down at me like he's about to devour me in one bite, but he takes a deep breath and kneels down in front of me, spreading my knees apart so he can push right up against me.he pulls me toward him and opens my lips with his.as our tongues meet, i feel his fingertips gliding softly over the top of my camisole, barely touching my right breast.i press forward into his hand, but he pulls back.i quickly learn my lesson and stay still as his fingers return, teasingly running just under the fabric.finally i feel him reach up with both hands and pull the cotton down and hook it under my breasts so it stays put.he dips his head and pulls my breasts together, taking one nipple into his mouth and sucking on it, then quickly moving over to the other.i moan and tilt my head back as my hands grip the comforter beside me.he backs off and takes the bottom hem of my shirt, pulling it off over my head."you have the most gorgeous breasts," he breathes, palming them as though he's sculpting clay."really?i've always been self-conscious of them.""why?"he looks at me in shock."they're perfect."he leans forward to kiss me softly, then begins to unbutton his jeans."wait, um, can i?"i stop him.he smiles at me and stands.i slowly reach forward and finish unbuttoning them, then move the zipper down.i can feel his eyes on me, but i keep my gaze on what i know is waiting for me underneath his denim.the arch of his cock is pressing against his boxer-briefs as i push his jeans past his knees.i pause and then take the sides of his waistband and pull them out and around.his thick mushroom tip springs out as soon i pull the boxers down.he's so big that i can't begin to imagine how he's going to fit inside me.my worry must read on my face, because he says, "we'll take it slow."i nod and push the boxers down to his jeans, holding them as he steps out of them.i gulp as i'm face-to-face again with his manhood."have you ever...?"he asks leadingly, nodding down at himself."never," i reply."give me your hands."i obey, reaching up to place mine in his large outstretched palms.he places one on his thigh, and brings the other to his shaft.he wraps it around the base, and then moves it up to his tip, then back down."just like that.nice and easy at first."he removes his hand and i keep going, feeling the soft, veiny skin of his cock ripple slightly at my touch.he takes my other hand and places it on his balls, massaging them with me.his hands then drop by his sides, and i look up to see his eyes closing and his lips parting.instinctively, i lean forward and, tucking my lips over my teeth, i take him inside my mouth.i hear him gasp and i smile inwardly.he doesn't know that i've read my fair share of dirty books, even if i've never actually put anything into practice.i keep moving my mouth down his length, seeing how far in i can take him.i stop when he hits the back wall of my mouth, though i'm still not at his base, and then begin to slide back out."oh, fuck, brynn.you sure you've never done this before?"he asks me, eyes wide as i swirl my tongue around his tip and then pull him back inside my mouth.i move my hand back to his balls and massage him again as i move up and down his dick.i hear him moan and feel his hand move to the back of my head, his fingers grasping my hair."enough," he grunts, pulling his hips back."stand up."normally when nate takes that tone with me or orders me around, it really gets under my skin.but right now, it's turning me the hell on.i jump to my feet.he abruptly takes the elastic waist of my pants and yanks them to the ground.we stand facing each other naked, the air between us charged.without taking his eyes off mine, he reaches forward and between my legs.i cry out softly as he slips one finger over my wet clit, and then inside me.i almost fall forward at the strength of my reaction to his touch, and have to grab onto his shoulders to support myself.he pulls me into him so that i'm curled against his chest, my head resting just under his chin.his finger moves in and out of me, and his thumb flicks over my clit.i reach down and begin to run my hand up and down his cock like he showed me, though i'm so turned on that i'm hardly aware of what i'm doing."you're almost ready," he whispers.he pulls his hand out of me and picks me up under the armpits and tosses me onto the bed.in a second he's pushing my legs apart and kneeling between them.his head ducks down and i buck wildly as his tongue takes a long lick of my clit.i feel him slip two fingers inside me, and can feel him pressing them all around, stretching me out.his tongue circles and flicks against me the whole time, until i begin to unravel."oh, nate, oh, yes!"i cry out, but he stops.i gasp at the sudden lack of contact and pick up my head to look at him.he's no longer between my legs, but standing to get something out of his jeans.he smiles at me as he shows me the condoms he's taking out of his pocket.he rips one off and pulls it open with his teeth, then tosses the rest on the bed next to me as he walks back.i watch as he holds it to his tip and then unrolls it down his shaft.then he kneels back on the bed, his legs between mine, and lies down on top of me with his weight on his elbows."this first time will probably hurt a little, but it'll feel good soon," he promises, brushing a strand of hair behind my ear.i nod nervously.he kisses me, his tongue softly caressing mine, as i feel his dick against my opening.i can't believe it's finally happening.he reaches down, pulling my leg up and holding it against his hip as he takes his cock in his other hand, positioning it at just the right angle.i gasp as he enters me and sharp pain reverberates through my entire lower half.i feel his hips stop their forward motion.he moves his mouth over to my ear, softly sucking on my earlobe and darting his tongue in and out as he moves forward again.the pleasurable sensation at my ear helps to distract me from the massive pressure i feel pressing into me.i close my eyes and wrap my arms around his back, willing myself to relax.i know i'm in good hands.just when i think the pain will be more than i can handle, he stops, and i can feel the skin around his hips pressing against mine.he's all the way in.he circles around slowly, and i feel my first twinge of pleasure at the sensation.he pulls his head back and looks at me."ok?"he asks.i nod, feeling breathless.without taking his eyes off me, he begins to pull back out, all the way to his tip, before sliding in again.he pulls out a second time, and as he returns, my lips part in surprise at my body's response.i think he can sense that i'm starting to warm to the sensation, because he begins to move a little faster."oh, nate, that feels... it feels..." i trail off.there are no words.i simply wrap my legs around his back and dig my hands into his hair as he moves against me, as exquisite waves flow through my body.his lips find mine again, kissing me with a passion that matches the faster pace he's setting.i feel an orgasm begin to build inside me.i've had orgasms before, including an amazing one with nate, but this one feels different.it's so powerful that it scares me.i bear down against it, holding my breath to keep it at bay.but everything nate is doing is working against me.i feel his hands move to my breasts, and my back arches against the heat of his palms.he kisses my neck as i bend to him, and his cock finds new and untouched nerve endings to drive me to the edge."oh, nate, it's too much..." i breathe, opening my eyes."i don't know if i can."he slows down for a moment."brynn, you're safe with me," he murmurs, his dark eyes finding mine, tenderness and passion mixed in them."you just have to let go.let go with me."he begins to speed up, but his eyes don't leave mine.i follow his advice, trying to let the orgasm take me rather than trying to control it."yes, yes, brynn," he grunts as my eyes roll back in my head.he slams his hips into me now, driving his cock inside me.i hear myself begin to moan as though i'm outside of my own body.his torso lifts off of me and he thrusts in a little deeper.the slightly new angle is enough to push me right over the edge.i completely lose control, my body arching with spasms of its own accord.i can vaguely feel him bucking on top of me, his sweat dripping down onto my skin.he collapses on top of me and i tuck my face into his neck.his body weight feels exactly right on top of me.i feel like i could stay like this forever.chapter twenty-one i wake up to soft kisses on my cheek.my eyes flutter open in surprise."mmm?"i murmur incoherently."you passed out," i hear nate whisper back.i realize he's still on top of me-and inside me."oh, sorry," i smile, blushing a bit."i hope i didn't make too much noise."he grins."well, i think if they'd heard anything, we would have known about it by now.""how long was i asleep for?""just twenty minutes or so.i was worried i was going to crush you."he kisses my lips and then reaches down.i watch him hold the base of the condom as he pulls out of me.the sensation of him leaving my body is jarring, and i lay still for another minute, absorbing it, as he walks to the bathroom.he comes back with a couple of wet tissues and i sit up to take them from him."it's ok," he says."lie back."i obey, and feel him carefully wiping up the inside of my thigh, and then begin to giggle.he stops and looks at me with a confused frown."i'm sorry, i just-i never thought i'd be in this position with nate thornhill!"i explain.he shakes his head with a bemused grin as i continue to giggle."you bled a little, but it didn't get on the comforter.that would have been tough to explain," he says as he returns to the bathroom."i could have just said i had my period," i point out as i pull my comforter back and crawl underneath the sheets."oh, i guess that's true," he says, coming back and sliding into bed next to me."i can't believe i'm not a virgin anymore," i grin as he wraps his arms around me and pulls me close."i was beginning to think it would never happen.""so... you liked it?"he asks, running his fingers up and down my arm.i'm shocked to feel my body respond hungrily, as though i haven't just had a mind-blowing orgasm twenty minutes ago."are you kidding me?"i ask, raising my eyebrows at him."what about me?was i..." "you were excellent," he assures me."it was different, though.""different, how?"i ask, frowning.he shrugs."i usually don't really know the girls i sleep with.or have feelings for them.even the ones i get to know, because we're hooking up regularly, i'll end it when they get too clingy."a fissure of concern rises in my chest."so... don't get clingy?""that wasn't a warning," he says, turning to me with a smile."besides, i don't think of you as clingy.stubborn, maybe.""gee, thanks," i reply, rolling my eyes."so, why did it never happen?losing your virginity?"he asks, turning to me and resting his head on his elbow."well, i guess it's not that surprising.i've never really dated.my first kiss was with this guy david in my junior year of high school.it was really fast.and gross.his tongue just sort of darted in and out of my mouth.and then senior year, and freshman year of college, a few guys took me out, but it never really went anywhere.i mean, they were fine, but i really wanted to dedicate myself to studying, and getting a scholarship and all that.""did your mom put a lot of pressure on you to do well in school?"i smile."the opposite, actually.she was always begging me to get my head out of a book and put on some lip gloss.which of course just made me want to stick my head even further into a book.i just never wanted to end up like her."nate raises his eyebrows at me, and i sigh."i mean, dependent on men.she never really learned how to do anything because she's so beautiful and charming and men would always do everything for her.but when i came along, they stopped coming around so much, and she had to take care of me all by herself.and even when they did, they'd eventually leave, and she'd be devastated.curled up in bed for days, depressed, unable to care for herself..." "so then you started taking care of her," he finishes.i nod.we settle back into the pillows for a minute."your mom should have known that not all books are created equal, though," nate begins thoughtfully."some are far more interesting than others.""what?"i ask, with absolutely no idea what he's talking about.with a devilish grin, he reaches over me and opens my bedside table.i shriek and grab his arm as i see his fingers graze over my copy of lady chatterley's lover.but to my far more infinite horror, his hand keeps searching back and returns to the bed with my hot pink vibrator."oh my god, put that back!"he ignores me, and studies it thoughtfully as my cheeks burn."someday i'd like to watch you use this on yourself," he comments.my mouth drops open and he glances up at me, his eyes boring into me."what do you think about that?""i... i don't know," i whisper."not tonight," he assures me, replacing the vibrator in the drawer and turning back to me."tonight, i'll do all the work."i gasp as i feel his fingers slip between my legs and rub against my clit."you have no idea how much it turns me on to be your first for all of this.""mmhm," i reply distractedly as my eyelids flutter.no way can i concentrate on speaking with his hand down there."brynn, keep looking at me.""why?"i whine."because i like to tease you," he replies simply.i bite my lip and turn my head back to him.his fingers rub my aching nub over and over again."i like it when you order me around," i whisper, feeling shocked to hear myself say such a thing out loud.his eyes widen."you do?""only in bed," i explain.i watch his pupils dilate and his jaw muscles contract, as though he's struggling against some powerful reaction.he sucks in a breath of air and then blows it out of his mouth slowly."oh, brynn, there are so many things i want to do to you.but we can't just jump from zero to sixty."i nod in understanding and then moan as he slips a finger inside me."you're so wet already.you want round two?"all i can do is moan in affirmation."turn around," he orders me, and a thrill of desire rushes through me.i obey, turning over onto my other side so that my back's to him.he runs his hand over my ass and then back between my legs and inside me.i hear him fumbling with his other hand and then the sound of a condom being ripped open."put your arms over your head," he tells me.i place them over my ears and onto the pillow, bending my elbows so that they don't hit the headboard.i feel his hand press down against my forearms, his long fingers easily reaching completely around me, and pinning me to the pillow.his other hand slides out of me and pulls my hips back toward him.i begin to tremble with anticipation, but don't have to wait very long.i feel his cock at my slit, pushing into me as he holds me in place.i cry out from pain and pleasure as he reawakens the soreness he created the first time, but unlike that time, the pleasure is also instant and intense.i feel his mouth at my ear."you like that?""yes, oh god, yes," i moan.he thrusts into me faster."it's so hard to hold back with you," he mutters, almost to himself."you don't have to," i reply.i hear him grunt in response and slam into me harder.suddenly i feel myself being picked up and turned over.before i know it, i'm on my hands and knees without nate and me ever losing contact.i have to bite my lip to keep myself from screaming out in pleasure as he pulls out and drives back in.he's in so deep now, pressing directly against my g-spot with every thrust.my body begins to shake with another orgasm and this time, i let myself go with it.i feel nate's hands pulling my hips back to meet his with every thrust as he comes with me.my elbows collapse down with the final shudder of my orgasm, and nate lands on top of me, immediately kissing the back of my neck."oh, brynn, i'm sorry," he murmurs, as he pulls my hair out of my face."sorry?why are you sorry?"i ask, befuddled."you're crying... i'm so sorry.i was too rough, i went too quickly, i-" he rushes on, sounding horrified.my brain tries to catch up with him."no, no.it didn't hurt.i didn't even realize i was crying.everything felt amazing."his body relaxes against mine."i was so scared for a second there.i thought i hurt you.""no, honestly..." i reach up to touch my face, and he's right-my cheeks are damp."that's so strange.this doesn't happen a lot?"he pulls himself up so he can look at me with an ironic grin."i do try not to make girls cry, brynn."i laugh."i'm sorry, i just meant... i wondered if this happens to other girls.i suppose i don't usually... you know, let go of control like that.maybe the emotional release..." "maybe.just as long as you're ok." "i'm more than ok," i assure him."sore?"i nod."a little.""i'll get you some water," he says, kissing the back of my shoulder before gently pulling out of me.he comes back from the bathroom with a glass for me, and sits up in bed with me as i drink it."i wish you could sleep here," i murmur, resting my head on his shoulder.i feel spent, relaxed... and happy."me too."chapter twenty-two the next morning, i wake up reaching for nate, but he's gone.i turn over onto my back in frustration.i thought that after we had sex my desire for him might fade a bit, become more manageable, but it's even stronger now.even though i can feel a little soreness and pain between my legs, i want him to take me again, and again, and again.i glance at the clock and am shocked to see it's almost noon.well, i guess i did have a big day yesterday, between almost sliding down that cliff and losing my virginity.i slide under the sheets to the side of the bed and sit up on the edge.i roll my ankle and find that there's barely any pain, though i guess i should leave the tape on for one more day just to be safe.i stand and pull on a pair of yoga pants and a t-shirt and head downstairs to the kitchen and fix myself some breakfast.my mom walks in just as i'm sitting down at the breakfast table."wow, that's a lot of food, brynn," she comments, raising her eyebrows at the amount of eggs and toast on my plate."starving," i reply, pausing only momentarily then continuing to shovel food into my mouth."i can see that.how's your ankle?""lot better."i clear my throat.i need to stop acting weird or my mom will know something's up.i put down my fork."did you have a nice lunch with pierce yesterday?where'd you go?""the palm," she replies."it was lovely.pierce is a regular there and always gets the best table.""oh, good."i glance up as nate slides opens the door from outside.he winks at me and i quickly bury my head back in my food so that my mom can't see the blush spreading across my cheeks."just returning from your morning workout, nate?"my mom asks as she begins to fix herself some tea."you're both getting such late starts today.""must've been that hike," nate replies nonchalantly."how's your ankle?""lot better," i repeat, holding it out from under the table and rolling it around to demonstrate."better keep the tape on for another day just to be safe.""that's just what i was thinking.""anybody want some coffee?i'm just putting some water on," my mom breaks in."yes, please," we both chorus."you know, i'm so glad you two are getting along.that'step' word has such a bad connotation, i suppose because of cinderella... you know, the wicked stepsisters.but of course, having a bigger family can be such a positive thing," she muses, turning up the burner on the stovetop.i watch her for a moment, wondering if she's trying to bring up something about what i said to her last night, about how she needs to get involved in pierce's harsh treatment of his son."very positive," nate replies seriously, not looking at me as i glare at him warningly.it is so not the time for one of his smartass comments."pierce and i are going to the farmer's market in about an hour.you guys want to come?"and miss a chance to be alone with nate?"i was thinking i was just going to sit by the pool today," i reply."give my ankle a little more time to heal.""probably wise," my mom agrees."what about you, nate?""i have to, um..." he trails off, trying to come up with an excuse."you know, i think my friend jackson might swing by later, so i better stay home.""ok, just the parents then," my mom with a faux sigh.nate and my mom both leave the kitchen to take their coffee into other rooms, so i can finish off my breakfast in peace.after i clean up my plates, i decide to head into the den and turn on the tv.my body needs to digest that giant breakfast i just devoured.pierce and my mom find me sitting in there on their way out the door, and i wave goodbye.but as soon as the door closes, a ball of excitement forms in my stomach.i'm alone with nate.i feel like a kid on christmas morning.i push aside the throw and stand up, heading for the stairs and nate's bedroom.a flurry of nerves hits me as i walk down the hallway and knock softly on his door."one sec!"he calls back."ok, come in."i push the door open to find him standing just outside his bathroom, a white towel wrapped around his waist.he's dripping wet, having clearly just stepped out of the shower."oh, it's you," he says with a smile.i shut the door behind me."they just left.""how are you feeling, really?i want to make sure i didn't go too fast last night.any regrets?"i walk toward him."i do have one regret."he frowns in concern, his beautiful forehead marred by a line in between his eyebrows."there was something i wanted to do last night, but i didn't get the chance."the tension immediately leaves his face."which was?"he asks, the edge of his mouth twisting up in a questioning smile.i reach forward and unwrap his towel in response, then kneel in front of him.i watch his cock grow hard in front of my eyes as he gazes down at me.without another word, i run my hands up the front of his thighs, feeling his leg hair under my palms disappear as it reaches the line of his hips.i lean forward, trailing kisses just under his belly button.he smells amazing-a heady mixture of fresh shower combined with the very personal scent of his package.it's unlike anything i've smelled before, and though i haven't been with anyone else, i bet the smell is all his own.i wrap my hands around the back of his thighs as i dip my head and kiss the base of his shaft.his cock jumps slightly in response to my touch, and i hear him groan.i wrap my hand around him, pulling him toward my mouth.i circle my tongue lightly around his tip, licking up a bead of liquid that has just appeared there.i move to the base of his dick, pressing my tongue down hard as i make my way back up the underside of his shaft, then flick my tongue around his tip.then i tuck my lips around my teeth and wrap them around him, stretching my mouth wide to receive him.i move slowly down his length, wanting to make him feel as good as he's been making me feel.and to tease him a little, too, if i'm being perfectly honest.i look up at him as i pull back, and see him biting his lip as he looks down at me.i circle his tip with my tongue for a minute as he watches me.i feel myself growing wet-why going down on him turns me on so much i don't know, but it does.his fingers wrap around the back of my head, digging into my hair, as he dips his head back.i take him in my mouth again and begin to move faster.i bring one hand up to massage his balls, and wrap the other around his shaft, following my mouth.i still can't fit his whole cock in my mouth, so i figure this is kind of a good cheat.my eyes begin to water a bit as i hear him begin to groan.i move even faster, excited to feel him come in my mouth, and to taste him."oh, fuck, fuck, i'm coming," he moans, and suddenly my mouth is filled with liquid.i keep moving my head back and forth even as i feel it leak a little out of the corner of my mouth.should i swallow it?i don't know what else to do, so i lean back for a moment and feel it run down my throat.nate's taking deep breaths above me, his chest heaving, so i lean forward again and kiss his shaft gently as it softens a bit.i guess i expected it to, you know, go down right away, but it stays mostly erect as i stand back up.to my surprise, he wraps his arms around me and kisses me.i thought he might feel some compunction considering where my mouth has been, but his tongue slips readily against mine and i relax against him.his hand slides down my ass and he rubs himself against me."how much longer do you think they'll be gone?"he asks breaking away and bringing his other hand up to my cheek."no idea.""well, i'll make this quick, just in case."he pushes me away and steps back."strip."i almost gasp at the pleasure his command sends rushing through me.i pull off my shirt and yoga pants, then unhook my bra and slide my panties to the ground as he watches.my lips part as he wraps his hand around his cock as it hardens completely again."i want you to go on birth control soon, ok?i don't want to have to wear a condom with you.""does it feel very different?""oh yeah.and i want to feel myself right up against you."he walks over to his bedside table and pulls a condom out and tosses it on the bed."come," he says, holding his hand out to me.i walk over, and he turns me around, pulling my back against him.i feel his cock hitting the small of my back as he runs his fingers over my stomach and then up over my breasts, gently pinching my nipples.i groan into his touch.i've never felt anything close to the way he makes me feel."a little faster and harder this time, ok?"he asks, and i nod, already beyond speaking.his fingers slide down and over my clit, and i can hear the sounds of my wetness as he presses one finger inside me."you're already so wet... good girl."his other hand snakes up to my face and turns my cheek so that i'm facing him.he kisses me, hard, his tongue ravaging my mouth as his finger circles inside my opening.his thumb flicks over my clit and i cry out in pleasure and surprise.as if he were just waiting for this response, he turns me around and pushes me down on my back on the bed.he picks up the condom next to me and quickly rips it open and pulls it on.he grabs my hips and steps forward, pulling my ass down so that it's just on the edge of the bed.he bends over me, quickly pulling my breast into his mouth and gently nibbling on my nipple.he moves his weight onto his elbows and i feel him pressing inside me.there's a slight soreness left over from last night, but also instant pleasure.he stretches me open, pushing slowly but surely until he's all the way in.my hands dig into his back as he thrusts again, a little harder.then he stands up, still inside me, and pulls my legs up so that my calves are resting on his shoulders.he moves his right hand over my crotch, and i moan as he begins to circle my clit with his thumb.i cry out as he begins to pull in and out of me at the same time, and i watch his face as he watches himself move inside my opening.the combination of his fingers on my clit and his cock inside me is quickly driving me crazy."aaggh," i cry out intelligibly, and nate's eyes snap up to my face.he removes his hand from my clit and leans forward so that both of his palms are spread on the comforter.my legs are still on his shoulders, and i can feel a good stretch in my hamstrings in this position.i'm also completely immobilized as he begins to drive into me in earnest now, his jaw tense and his neck muscles bulging.i close my eyes and lose myself to the sensation of being drilled over and over again.he's hitting me so deeply, and i'm absolutely out of control and powerless.maybe it would make me nervous with some other man, but i feel completely safe with nate.as an orgasm begins to rip through me, i feel his hands gripping my shoulders tightly, pulling me down against him as he comes inside me."brynn, oh, fuck, brynn!"he shouts as he releases himself.my legs fall off his shoulders and splay onto the comforter as he collapses on top of me.i gasp for air, and drowsily wipe the hair out of my face as i feel him stir on top of me.he picks his head up and listens for a moment."they're still not home.""mm, guess not," i murmur rather incoherently."good," he says with a wicked smile, and begins to kiss down the middle of my chest as he slides to his knees on the floor."nate, what are you-oh, god," i moan, as he takes a long lick of my slit."i can't wait until tonight to taste you again.it's like i'm addicted to this, to you."i close my eyes as he begins to flick his tongue across my clit.i thought i was completely worn out, but i'm coming back to life shockingly quickly under his deft tongue.his hands pin my knees to the sides of the bed, stretching me wide open so that he has complete access and control.i feel his tongue dart in and out of me-a completely different sensation than when he uses his fingers.my back arches off the bed as he moves back to my clit, circling it relentlessly.i whimper as i feel waves of pleasure begin to reverberate through my body.my body wants to rock and shake, but nate's hands pin me firmly to the bed, and his tongue keeps flicking across me.my energy has no choice but to be completely directed to the reaction he's eliciting.for some reason, it's when nate backs off slightly that my body rocks into a full-out orgasm, my back arching wildly off the bed, just the top of my head and my hips remaining in contact with the comforter."oh my god," i breathe as i relax down.i lift my head slightly and watch him lick his lips before lying down next to me on the bed and lazily flopping an arm over my waist."we should get dressed," he reminds me, kissing me quickly before jumping back up.i groan.where's he getting all this energy?i feel like i could sleep for days."do you think there will ever be a day when we can tell them?"i ask with a yawn as i sit up.he pauses for a moment as he pulls open a dresser drawer."i don't know.let's just keep it our secret for now.""no, no, i wasn't saying i-" i break off as we both hear a car pulling up to the front of the house.i hurry over to the pile of my clothes and ball them up in my arms before running to the door."see you later!"i call quietly over my shoulder as i dash naked down the hallway.as i shut my door behind me and begin pulling on my clothes, i wonder why nate was so quick to suggest that we keep it quiet.not that i want something different-for now, at least.but someday...i mean, does he just envision keeping our relationship secret forever?what kind of relationship would that be, anyway?i sigh.these kind of questions are what allison warned me about in the first place.it's just... fuck.what was once a far-off crush has become real for me.too real.and nate has said he has feelings for me, that i'm different, but he hasn't been any more specific than that.on my end, i don't think this is a purely sexual infatuation.i'm really falling for him.chapter twenty-three going to work this week and being away from nate during the day has felt like going through physical withdrawal.i really have to force myself to focus, because sometimes i find myself staring off into the distance, remembering what he did to me the previous night.i wish i could just go straight home at six today, but i promised allison i'd go shopping with her.and there are actually a couple things i'd like to pick up for myself.i meet her at the anthropologie in georgetown mall, and we start going through the sale racks as we catch up.while she's not looking, i slip a couple sets of lingerie and sexy bras into my basket.i want to wear something a little sexy for nate, but i don't want to face allison's inevitable questions if she sees what i've picked out.we eventually make our way to the changing rooms and begin trying on our choices.i quickly slip on the first matching set of bra and panties.i admire myself in the mirror.the lace is a pale violet, and not overtly sexy-it's anthropologie, not victoria's secret, after all."what do you think?"allison asks suddenly, pulling the curtain aside and stepping into the dressing room with me.she's wearing a blue cotton dress and twirls for a second before she realizes what i'm wearing.her eyebrows raise."whoa.""allison," i groan, pulling one of the more substantial pieces of clothing off a hanger to cover myself."you know, i had a feeling something was different with you," she says, beginning to smile."really?""yup.and i was right.i always thought you two would make a good match.""what?that's not what you said.""yeah, i totally called it!""no, you completely warned me against the whole thing," i reply, confused and even slightly annoyed."wait," she says with a frown, "who are you talking about?""who are you talking about?""greg, obviously..." "oh, right.""brynn..." "what?"i ask innocently."if it's not greg, who did you think i was talking about?"she asks, her eyes widening."it's not important, ok?"i reply, blushing."brynn, no.please tell me it's not nate.please.i mean, he's your stepbrother.it's... it's gross.""thanks a lot, allison.not exactly what i needed to hear right now," i snap, turning my back to her to pull off the lingerie."um, maybe it's exactly what you need to hear right now.i mean, what's with you?you're ignoring a perfectly nice guy to go out with some jock like nate.""well, first of all, it's none of your business.second of all, you're actually completely right about greg.he is'perfectly nice.'there's no spark at all.zero.third of all, nate's not'some jock.'he's really smart, and kind, and funny.and with him?sparks galore!""god, brynn, i'm just trying to look out for you.you're making some really bad decisions."i take a deep breath, not wanting to raise my voice in this public place."no, allison, you're not trying to look out for me.what you're doing is judging me.completely different.and i really don't appreciate it."i finish pulling on my skirt and quickly slip my flats on as i grab my purse and walk quickly out of the dressing room.i walk straight out of the store and toward the elevator to the parking garage, my cheeks burning with anger, though i also feel a bit like crying.i've never had a big fight like that with allison before, and i don't like it.i freeze outside another store just as i'm about to reach the elevators.victoria's secret.my relationship with nate isn't "gross."there's nothing wrong with what we're doing.if anything, my conversation with allison has made me want to lean into my relationship with nate, not out of it.i march in and straight to the raciest pieces i see.when i get home, i hear my mom and pierce laughing in the kitchen, and the tv from the den.i walk in there and smile in relief at the sight of nate with his feet up on the couch.he moves his legs over and i plop down."hi," i murmur with a smile."hi," he replies."what's wrong?"i frown at him, and he reaches up to his shoulder, miming pulling at something.i stare at him for a moment before realizing he's mirroring my own action of pulling at my hair.i sigh and drop my hand."it's allison.we had an argument," i explain."she... she found out."he cocks his head and then lets out a low whistle as he realizes what i mean."well, i suppose it's not that bad.i mean, i always thought..." he lowers his voice, looking back toward the kitchen where our parents are still talking."i always thought that at school, we could be more open.no one really knows you're my stepsister there.i mean, allison would have found out then anyway, right?""i guess so... she just... She called it'gross.'we're not, are we?""well, i certainly don't think there's anything gross about you.""it's more than that, though.i feel like we're drifting apart a little," i reveal, swallowing a ball of hurt in my throat."mm," he replies, considering."like me and jackson, sort of.well, maybe you won't be quite as close as you were, but there are still things you can enjoy about her.""when'd you get so wise?"i ask, nudging his feet next to me."since i started hanging out with you.you're rubbing off on me."before i have time to consider whether he's being serious or not, we hear my mom call, "dinner!"from the kitchen, and are forced to put our conversation on hold.pierce seems to be in an unusually good mood during the meal, for which i'm grateful.not for his sake, but for nate's, because he's much less likely to snap at his son when he's feeling jovial."well, we haven't made an official announcement, brynn, but thornhill and co. has just landed mark broadman as a client," he reveals eventually."the hedge fund billionaire?""that's right.he has several new holdings, and needs advice on some public policy matters.""wow, that's huge.congrats, dad," nate chimes in.pierce nods at him in a self-satisfied manner."i'm glad it's all-i'm glad that's happened, pierce," i correct myself.i almost referenced the scandal earlier this summer, but managed to change course.we never talk about it now, though i know that pierce was concerned that it would negatively impact his business.but landing such a big client is a good sign that people have moved on, and are on pierce's side.after dinner, nate and i leave the dining room separately, while our parents remain there chatting.we always make a show of going our separate ways, to keep up appearances.i close my bedroom door knowing that he'll come for me around midnight, as he has every night this past week.my body quivers with excitement just thinking about it.i consider writing an email to allison, but decide i want a little more time to think about what to say.i turn to my purse and pull out the bag from victoria's secret that i stuffed to the bottom.i touch the black lace panties, a narrow diamond-shaped piece of fabric that just covers the essentials, with several thin strips, string, really, hooking around my hips and latching on to the back.the bra is conservative by contrast, though pretty with its chantilly lace-covered cups.i take a shower and then head downstairs for a cup of tea.i'm taking a mug down from the top cupboard when i feel nate come up behind me.he wraps his hands around my waist and presses against me."nate, not here!"i whisper."i know, i'm sorry," he murmurs in my ear."i just want you all the time.""i have a surprise for you tonight," i admit.he grinds his erection into my ass in response, his hands reaching under my shirt."you're killing me," he moans, then sighs, and rests his head on mine before pulling away."see you soon."i lean against the counter as i hear him retreat, my skin tingling where he's touched it.i know that sneaking around won't work forever, but for now, there's something so hot about it.i take my decaf earl grey up to my room, and change into the lingerie as i drink it, carefully pulling out the tags.i sink into bed with a yawn, pulling the sheet up over me.these late night assignations, while i wouldn't give them up for anything, are wreaking havoc on my sleep schedule.the next thing i know, i'm being woken up by someone sinking into bed next to me.i turn into the warmth of nate's body and slowly open my eyes."sorry, should i just let you sleep?"he asks, kissing the top of my head."no way," i reply drowsily."you have to have your surprise.""where is it?"he asks, looking around.i lift my arm and point down at my body.he grins, and pinches the top of the sheet in his fingers and begins to slowly pull it down.i bite my lip as i hear his sharp intake of breath as he reveals my bra.he pauses, looking up at my face."there's more," i promise him.he keeps pulling the sheet down, and finally pulls it over the barely-there panties.he tosses the sheet at my feet and runs his hand from my knee up my inner thigh."what shall i do with you tonight, brynn?"he asks, eyeing my lingerie."whatever you want," i breathe."stand up," he says abruptly.i stand, and he eyes me up and down, licking his lips, then narrows his eyes."you have any high shoes?""you mean heels?"i ask, with a smile."yeah.""put them on."i walk over to my closet and slip them on, then walk back."better?"i ask, turning a little so he can see me from other angles."nothing could make you look any better than you already do, brynn.it wasn't about your appearance, it was about your height."i frown at him in confusion."come here," he says, walking over to the bedpost nearest to the door.i follow him.he takes me by the hips and moves me so that my back is pressed up against it."you remember what happened in this exact spot?the first time i tried to kiss you, you denied me."i smile."i remember how much self-control it took.""good answer.stay there."he walks over to my bureau and rummages around until he pulls out a couple of my old t-shirts and then walks back."close your eyes."i obey, and feel him wrap one of the shirts around my head, tying it in the back but slightly to the side, so that it doesn't hit the bed post.as he steps back, i try to open my eyes to test the blindfold, and find i can't see anything."you trust me?"he asks.i nod."hands behind your back.grip the bedpost."i feel my insides clench as i obey, spreading my palms against the solid wood of the bed.a moment later, i feel the other t-shirt wrapping around both my wrists and the posts, holding me securely against it."pull against it."i try, but don't get anywhere."good."i can sense him leaning in toward me, and feel the heat emanating from his body."brynn, tonight i'm going to make you beg for it, understand?"i feel his warm breath against my cheek and squirm in anticipation against my bondage."i'm going to deny you until you can't take it anymore.until you beg me.say that you understand.""i understand."he's barely touched me, and i can already feel how wet i am against my new panties.suddenly, i feel his fingertips on my arm, just above where the t-shirt is holding me to the bed.he trails his fingers lightly up my arm, barely touching me.my mouth drops open and i feel my heart rate speed up.his fingers continue across my clavicle, then down my other arm.as they make their way back up, i attempt to arch against him, but i can't.he stops for a moment, then continues, his touch leaving a burning trail across my body.his fingers run straight down my chest and over the middle of my bra.just as i think he's going to skip my breasts entirely, he moves back up and barely grazes the tops of my breasts, just above the cups.i gasp as he makes contact, but he quickly moves away, running his fingers down to my ribcage, then across my stomach.they dip for a moment into my belly button, and i hope he's going to continue down to my panties, but he skips them entirely, jumping down to the top of my thighs.he traces the length of one of my legs, then moves to the other.as his fingers reach the top of my left leg, he breaks off contact.i feel sweat collect on my palms, despite the coolness of my bedroom.where is he?suddenly i feel his breath on my neck.then his tongue is inside my ear, taking a long, languid lick.i moan, and my hands grip the bedpost more tightly.i hear him click his tongue."brynn, we've barely even started."i let my head fall back against the bedpost.how long is he going to torture me?as if in response, his hand slides up my neck to my chin, holding my face in place.his lips press against mine, roughly opening my mouth to his tongue.then he steps into me, his legs spreading mine open, his arms wrapping tightly around my waist.the full contact is sweet relief, even if it does make me want him even more.his right hand glides over my ass and pulls me against his erection.my mouth is wide open to his, and our tongues massage each other's.his other hand glides up my stomach and slips under my bra cup.i moan as i feel his calloused palm against my nipple.he pulls his mouth away quickly and leans his torso back.his fingers brush against the front of my bra for a moment, and then i feel his deft fingers unhook the front closure of my new bra.i feel my breasts spring out, and his thumbs brush against my nipples as he cups them in his hands.he begins to massage them more strongly, and suddenly i feel him sucking my right nipple into my mouth.he flicks his tongue across it as he sucks, then moves to my other side."i'm ready," i moan."uh-uh, not yet," he replies, pulling my breast out of his mouth for a moment.then he begins to trail kisses down my stomach, pausing for a moment to circle his tongue in my belly button.i feel him graze his fingers across the narrow strips of fabric on the sides of my panties."i like these very much," he murmurs."maybe we'll try to keep these on."then he's gone.i hear the sounds of what could be his shirt being pulled over his head, but i can't be sure.there's silence for another minute, and i'm suspended in this pool of pleasure where he's left me, completely under his control.i gasp as i feel him blow a stream of warm breath against my panties and feel my body shake involuntarily.his hands run up my thighs and then under the sides of my underwear, and i know he must be kneeling in front of me.i feel him slowly dip one finger under the right side of my panties, pulling them away from my body and tucking them to the other side.he blows on me again, and now his breath hits my clit directly."spread your legs," he commands me quietly.i obey, inching myself out on my high heels.his tongue slides into my slit and i cry out."oh, nate," i moan, and he begins to flick his tongue back and forth across me.i unravel quickly, and he begins to speed up, circling his tongue rapidly.but just as i'm on the brink, my body arching as much as it can, he slows down again.i whimper.he doesn't stop completely, but he's not going fast enough to bring me release.his right hand slips over my ass, under the fabric of my panties.i gasp as he slips one finger inside me.i've never had anything back there.he circles it inside me, mirroring his actions with his tongue.once i get over my surprise at the foreign feeling, i find that i like it.on top of everything that he's already done to me, and is still doing, it's driving me right toward the edge again.i moan as he slips two fingers from his other hand inside my opening, making a beckoning motion against my g-spot.i feel a spasm begin to rip through my body, but he pulls his mouth away completely.my knees almost buckle at the empty feeling he's left behind."nate..." i protest.he leans back in, flicking his tongue once, hard, over my clit.my body ripples in response.the pleasure has built up inside me to such an extent that being unable to let go of it feels painful.i need him to let me come."yes?"he answers innocently, and tortures me with another hard flick of his tongue, his fingers still circling slowly inside me."please..." the pleasure is overloading my brain, and i can barely think."please what?""i need you... please.i need you inside me right now.please, i'm begging you.i'm begging you, nate."i almost faint with relief as he takes his fingers out of me and i hear the sound of a condom being ripped open.he steps into me and grabs one of my legs, wrapping it around his waist as he thrusts into me.i cry out at the contact.he drives in hard, slamming me against the bed post, and on just his second thrust, i feel my orgasm finally releasing through me as he presses into me again and again.his mouth covers mine as the last waves of pleasure crest over me.even though i'm exhausted, i can feel that he's still hard inside me.i feel him reach behind me, and realize that he's unknotting the t-shirt around my hands.my arms drop to my sides, and he pulls out of me.i feel him taking my hips and turning me, then he presses one hand roughly down on my back and i realize he's pressing my top half down onto the mattress.i turn my head to the side so i can breathe as he pulls my panties, still bunched to one side, to my ankles.his hand still holding me down, i feel him enter me from behind.even though i'm spent from my first orgasm and all the build-up leading to it, i feel my body begin to respond again.i feel him slide his thumb into my ass and gasp.i never realized how many nerves endings were back there."brace yourself," he warns me, and begins to thrust harder into me.my fingers search for the edge of the bed and i'm just able to grasp it as he drives in deeper than he ever has before.he plunges into me again and again, hitting my g-spot directly every time.a second orgasm takes me by surprise, as though it was lying dormant until he awoke it.my body arches and shakes as i feel him pull out of me and a wetness cover my back.as my body quiets, i hear him hurrying to the bathroom and then him rubbing a tissue on my back."i'm sorry, i don't know why i did that," he murmurs."hm?did what?"i mumble, reaching up to remove the makeshift blindfold from my eyes."i... i came on you," he replies, halting his wiping motions to look me in the eye."nate... it's ok.it doesn't bother me," i assure him."really?"he asks, looking relieved."i've never done that before, i just... i just wanted to see it on you, or something.i'm worried... I worry i push you too far.""i like what we do together," i reply, stretching my arms above my head."as far as i'm concerned, we're going to do a lot more, so you better get used to it.""is that so?"he asks, with a smile."yep.now clean me off.if we're going to do this again tomorrow night, i need to get some sleep."chapter twenty-four the next day, thornhill and co. is abuzz with the official announcement of mark broadman becoming a new client.there's talk that other high-profile investors could follow suit, including some of broadman's contacts in silicon valley.apparently the tech crowd is quite interested in influencing public policy.i'm just glad that everyone is in such a good mood, because it helps me fit in.my relationship with nate, not to mention our late night sessions, has me practically glowing.constance talks to me happily in our cubicle, the awkwardness of our first day of working together having finally melted away over the summer months.she swivels in her chair and raises her eyebrows at me as greg walks by, giving me a small wave."ok, what happened there?"she asks conspiratorially."it was nothing," i assure her, keeping my eyes on my computer, though i can see out of my periphery that she's still looking at me."oh, come on.i won't tell.but it's obvious... i mean, for a couple weeks you guys were hanging out a bunch, and now he completely avoids you."i sigh."we went on a couple dates, and then we decided to break it off.but please keep it between us, alright?""mmhm," constance murmurs, swiveling back around.she can sense, rightfully so, that i'm not telling her the whole story.greg reacted as well as could be hoped when i told him i didn't want to go on any more dates with him.i blamed the office environment, and said i had extra pressure on me to be professional as the boss's stepdaughter, but i think he saw through that excuse.at least he could never guess the real reason.now whenever i see him he's polite but standoffish.i watch the corner of my screen, waiting to see if allison will send me a gchat message, but none arrives.i'll give it a little more time, and then reach out to her.i don't want to throw our whole friendship away over my relationship with nate-not that we don't have some things to talk about.it's not that i need her approval exactly, but i do need her to stop judging."lunch," constance says, nudging me.i stand up and see other people making their way to the big conference room.pierce has had lunch catered for the whole office to celebrate the new client.as we walk in, i notice that the temporary wall to the kitchen has been pulled back to make way for everyone.pierce and roderick, his business partner, stand by the buffet, happily talking with their employees.pierce smiles at me as constance and i make our way up to grab some plates."roderick, you've met my stepdaughter brynn, right?""yes, good to see you again, brynn," roderick, a well-dressed man a bit younger than pierce says, then turns away to shake someone's hand.pierce leans in."you look particularly beautiful today, brynn," he remarks."oh, thank you, pierce," i reply, a bit taken aback.constance and i stand around the conference room for a while talking to the other interns, everyone sharing their plans for once they get back to school, and the rising seniors, like me, discussing what we'll do after we graduate.eventually the crowd begins to thin out, and constance and i each take a cupcake back to our cubicle."what's that?vanilla?"she asks.i peer at the frosting."i think so, though i heard there were some coconut-" i break off as my desk phone rings.i look at it in surprise for a second-no one ever calls me on it-then reach forward to pick it up."brynn speaking.""brynn, it's pierce.could you come into my office for a moment?""oh, sure, i'll be right there."i hang up and stand."pierce," i explain to constance."probably wants to see if i'll be home for dinner tonight."she nods, and i walk down the hallway to his corner office."he asked me to-" i explain to his secretary, gwen."sure, go on in," she replies, waving me in.i knock softly as i open the door.he beckons me inside and indicates i should take a seat across from his desk."brynn, thanks for coming in," he says, standing and walking around his desk as he takes his reading glasses off and places them on his desktop calendar.i look at him curiously as he sits on the edge of his desk in front of me."i know that i'm just your stepfather, but i hope that you know that you can always come to me with any... difficulties.""um, sure.yes, thanks," i stumble, surprised by the direction of the conversation.he stands and begins to pace behind my chair."you're a very beautiful young woman, and i hope that you can see me as a sort of protector."i feel him come up and stand behind the chair.i start as he brushes my hair to the side and i feel his fingers graze against my skin just above the fabric of my dress."i couldn't help but notice this," he says."what?"i ask, frowning."this bruise," he explains, still holding my hair to the side."oh."my mind races.shit.i bet i got it last night when nate had me up against that bed post, and of course it's not in the sort of position where i'd see it."um, it's nothing.it's probably old, maybe from when i fell on that hike.""i doubt it.i mean, how far does it extend..." i'm horrified to feel him unzip the top of my dress, all the way down to my bra strap.he spreads his fingers across my back and a sickening feeling spreads through my body with them."brynn, you have such a beautiful body.you shouldn't be with someone who treats you with less respect than you deserve."his fingertips just touch the top of my bra strap."pierce!"i exclaim, and jump up."i really don't think this is appropriate," i admonish him with as much confidence as i can muster, while reaching behind myself to pull my zipper up."brynn, i'm just trying to look out for you.you clearly need a father figure in your life.""i'm just fine, thank you very much," i reply shortly, glaring at him as i manage to zip my dress.i march to the door, taking a deep breath to compose myself as i walk through the door.i walk right past my desk and into the bathroom, quickly locking myself inside a stall.i lower the toilet seat and sit down, pressing my hands onto my burning cheeks.i know pierce's words were saying one thing, but his actions, his touch, were saying quite another.it just felt wrong.by the time i sit back down at my desk, i'm already second-guessing myself.maybe i misread his behavior; maybe he was just trying to look out for me, but he's never had a daughter, so he didn't realize he was making me uncomfortable."you ok?"constance asks over her shoulder."i'm fine," i reply, pushing my uneaten cupcake away.i'm not hungry anymore.i manage to make it through the rest of the work day, though i know that i'll just have to see pierce at home for dinner.as i drive home, i wonder if i should say i'm sick or something so i'll be able to just be by myself in my room.but as i walk in through the garage, my mom calls me into the kitchen.i carefully spread my hair over my neck to hide the bruises, then walk in."oh, brynn, honey, i'm so glad you're home.come look," she gushes, pulling me into the dining room.i see that she's set it with fine china and crystal, and a massive vase of white lilies sits in the center."i thought i'd do something a little special tonight to celebrate.what do you think?""looks great, mom," i reply half-heartedly.if she notices my downtrodden mood, she doesn't mention it, she just sweeps me back into the kitchen to show me the extravagant meal she's spent the day preparing.when pierce comes home about half an hour later, he quickly enters his study, calling to us that he has to make a quick call.my mom asks me to carry the roasted duck out on a silver tray, and i acquiesce, knowing i'd feel too guilty to fake sick when she's spent so much time on the food.when i walk back into the kitchen, pierce is murmuring into my mom's ear as she blushes, so i quickly back out again.i hear nate enter through the front door, and he walks into the dining room just as i'm leaning on the back of my chair."hey," he says with a smile."i was thinking about you-" he breaks off as my mom and pierce walk in.pierce brandishes a bottle of champagne and walks around filling up our crystal flutes.i step back to give him a wide berth, and then we all sit down as he finishes filling up his own glass."cheers," he says.i avoid his eye contact as we all clink our glasses.nate frowns at me slightly and i know he can tell there's something up.oh god, i can't even think about talking to him later tonight.he can always tell when i'm lying, so i don't know what i'm going to say."brynn, did you messenger those envelopes like i asked?"pierce says, turning to me."hm?"i ask, startled by his question."the envelopes.i wanted to double check because you've seemed so distracted lately, and they're quite important."i frown at him.what the hell?"you didn't ask me to messenger anything today, pierce.""brynn," he sighs in a patronizing way, setting down his champagne glass."you didn't!"i reply, a little more defensively than i mean to.i glance at nate and see him raising his eyebrows at me."you know that i did.and it's not like this is the first time this has happened," pierce counters."maybe we should-" my mom breaks in."wait, no," i say to her, holding up my hand."i honestly don't know what you're talking about pierce.""well, this clearly isn't the time to discuss it, but since you're pressing me, i've heard from some of your immediate superiors that you haven't been very responsible.""what?like who?when?""obviously i can't give you exact dates, and i need to protect their anonymity-" "wow.wow," i snap, tossing down my napkin."you are just making all this up, aren't you?""brynn, calm down," nate murmurs from across the table."calm down?seriously?he's lying!""he has no reason to-" nate argues."he damn well does.he called me into his office today and unzipped my dress, and i told him to back off, and now he's pissed.""you know that's because i was worried about those bruises on your neck, brynn.don't get hysterical.""you're a liar," i whisper.he slams his hand down on the table, causing me to jump."i will not be spoken to that way in my own house!"i glance back and forth at my mom and nate, speechless.are they really just going to sit there staring at me?i stand up so abruptly that my chair almost falls over backward.i can't take being surrounded by this bullshit anymore.i walk quickly around the table and then out the front door, clenching my fists to try to contain my anger until i'm outside.as i close the door behind me, i pick up my pace, walking straight down the driveway and out of the gates.the woods rise up quiet and dark around me as tears of frustration and humiliation begin to stream down my face.i don't know where i'm going-i just need to get away from that house."hey!wait!"i hear a woman's voice call out behind me, but i keep walking."you're brynn, right?"i freeze and take a deep breath before turning around."look, if you're a reporter or something, i'm really not in the mood."i can just see her blonde hair reflect the moonlight as she takes a couple steps closer."i'm not a reporter.i'm nate's mom, eileen."chapter twenty-five "are... are you alright?"she asks, taking another step toward me."i'm, i'm just-" i break off as a sob escapes my lips."i'm sorry.""it's alright.i've got some tissues in my car-why don't you come sit down for a moment."i nod.in a saner moment, i might have questioned the safety of getting into a strange woman's car, but this is not a sane moment.she wraps her arm around my shoulders and leads me to the passenger side of her blue sedan, parked just down the street from the gates of the house.she sits me down then hurries around to the driver's side and gets in."here you go," she says, pulling a box of tissues from the floor of the back seat."thanks," i murmur rather incoherently.she flips on the car's overhead light."oh!"i exclaim."you're the woman from the boathouse parking lot."she smiles wryly."i thought you saw me that day.i'm not a stalker or anything.it's just, sometimes i like to get a glimpse of him, that's all.see what he looks like, how he's doing.""i understand.""but what's happened to you?is there anything i can do?""it's pierce," i murmur as more tears fall from my eyes at the mention of his name."what'd he do now?""he... he made a pass at me at work.i mean, i actually wasn't sure that's what it was right after, but then tonight he got on my case about something i didn't even do, and that's when i knew for sure.""oh, sweetie, i'm sorry," she says, rubbing my shoulder."pierce has a serious case of entitlement.he thinks that anything with a vagina is fair game, even his stepdaughter, it seems.""i mean, i already knew he was an asshole from the way he treats nate, but i just hadn't felt it directed at me yet."she stills."he doesn't treat nate well?"she asks quietly."oh, oh, i'm sorry," i reply, looking at her through bleary eyes."he's... he's very hard on nate.he calls him entitled, selfish, when i think those are really things he knows deep down are true about himself.""my little nate," she murmurs to herself."but he's really... nate is a good person, you should know that.well, to be honest, at first i thought he was more like pierce, but that's just a cover.maybe it's that half his genes are yours, or maybe his father raised him to be a better person than he is himself, i don't know.but he's smart, funny, hardworking..." "thank you," she says, taking my hand."i'm sorry you have to go through this.did you tell your mom?""she found out at dinner, but..." i shake my head."she's completely under pierce's spell.she gets like that about men, but i've never seen her quite so enamored of one before him.she looks a lot like you, actually," i realize, studying her beautiful, slightly lined face."pierce certainly has a type," she says with a sad smile."there's another thing you should know... about nate... i found out after you called : he thinks you left because he was too much for you, because he was a bad kid, basically.i tried to talk to him about it, really, but he wouldn't hear it.""nate was a wonderful child, and even if he'd been the devil incarnate, i still wouldn't have left him.""yeah, i figured as much.he said that the night before you left, you and pierce had a big fight over him, because he misbehaved, and that's why you left the next day.""oh, god," she murmurs, covering her face in her hands."he must have felt so alone, so responsible.no... i remember that fight, because it was our last.we'd been to some big gala that night, and we'd seen this woman there who was in our circle at the time.i knew he'd cheated before, but he promised me he'd stopped, and then at this party, i could just tell by the way they looked at each other that they were sleeping together.i confronted him about it at home, and he barely even bothered to deny it.i was yelling at him, asking what kind of example he was setting for his son.i left... i never thought that would be one of the last times i'd see nate.i never thought that was even a possibility.""i want to help you," i say suddenly."what?no.you have too much going on already," eileen says, shaking her head emphatically."no, i want to.not just for you, either.for nate.he needs you in his life.i can tell that you're good, and kind, and he needs people like that to love him.please let me help you.""i don't want to put you in a position... i don't want to jeopardize anything.you and nate, you have a special relationship.""um, sure, yeah, he's a great guy," i hedge."brynn... it's ok.i know."i swallow."know what?""when i saw you that day at the boathouse, i could just tell.at first i thought you were his girlfriend, and then i realized who you were, and i saw the way you two looked at each other.you're in love," she whispers.i begin to tug at my hair nervously.shit.shit."you've acted on your feelings?"it's all i can do to nod."do your parents know?"i shake my head."brynn, you don't have to be embarrassed.life's messy.people find love wherever they can.hell, it's not like you're breaking any laws."my tears begin to slip down my face again, renewed."i can't believe it's so obvious.""maybe i just caught you two in an unguarded moment.but, see, if nate and you are together, i don't want to come between you.""honestly, i'd like him to meet you.i think it might do him some good.when pierce was chewing me out tonight, he didn't say anything.""i'm sorry.""so you'll meet with him?""if you're sure it's ok with you.""i'm not sure how i'll set it up yet, but write down your number for me, and i'll get in touch with you when i know."she nods and tears a slip of paper from a paperback book in the back seat.as she hands it to me and i get out of the car, she leans over into the passenger seat."brynn, if i could just give you a little advice... i would avoid pierce for the next few days.he doesn't like it when people stand up to him."i nod and shut the door, walking slowly back to the house as i run my fingers over her phone number.i peer cautiously through the first floor windows, not wanting to walk back in on dinner, but it looks like they've finished and the plates have all been cleared.i quietly open the front door and tiptoe up the stairs to my bedroom, locking my door behind me.i put eileen's phone number on my bureau and am just about to change out of my dress when i hear a soft knock on the door.usually nate just comes in now, so he clearly knows that i'm upset with him.i walk over and unlock it, then open it a few inches."you locked it?"he asks, looking hurt."i want to be alone right now," i murmur, though a knot forms in my throat at the thought of spending the first night in a week without him."i... i can't choose between you," he whispers.he looks so forlorn, and i see a glimpse of the little boy that he once was, overhearing his parents' arguments."i know.""they're going to some charity lunch tomorrow afternoon... maybe we could spend some time together.""ok," i nod, my mind already moving in a different direction.he pauses, unsure if he should kiss me."alright, goodnight," he says, and walks down the hallway to his bedroom.i close and lock the door after him, then grab my cell phone and put in eileen's number.tomorrow afternoon, i text her.i'll let you know when my parents are gone, and then you come meet nate.chapter twenty-six i yawn as i sit by my window, waiting for the sounds of my mom and pierce leaving.i wasn't able to sleep well at all last night.there were too many worries rattling around in my brain.mainly, though, it felt strange not to see nate.i missed his presence in my bed with a physical ache that gnawed away at me.finally i hear some movement in the rest of the house.i walk to my door and crack it open, sticking my head out into the hall.i can just hear my mom murmuring something to pierce as they make their way to the garage.soon i hear the car pulling out of the driveway and i glance at the clock.i'll give them ten minutes.i wait impatiently, and as soon as it's up, i text eileen and head down to the foyer.luckily nate has been safely ensconced in his room all morning.i don't know if he even got up to train this morning, which is highly unusual for him.i glance out the window next to the door and see eileen walking up the driveway."hi," i murmur quietly as she reaches the steps and i open the door."hi," she replies nervously, smoothing her blouse."do i look alright?""you look fine," i assure her.i can't imagine how she must feel, finally seeing her son face-to-face after all these years.she looks around the foyer."god, this place is even bigger than it looks from outside.""i know.it's ridiculous," i agree, and usher her into the den."pierce and my mom are at some charity lunch, so they'll be gone for a while," i tell her.she bites her lip nervously and takes a seat on the couch."i'll call nate down, alright?i haven't told him anything... i wasn't sure he would come otherwise."she nods, and i head to the stairs."hey, nate?"i yell, and hear his bedroom door open."you wan na come down to the den?"i feel a fissure of guilt as he replies happily, "sure!be right there," and i hear him moving around.i don't like the idea of setting a trap and lying to him, but i rationalize that it's in the service of a greater truth, that of the true nature of his parents' relationship, and his father's character.i walk back into the den, and stand nervously next to the couch where eileen's sitting.she stands as we hear nate walking down the stairs, and then he turns the corner and sees us.his face is a blank as he surveys the scene before him.he takes a step forward, looks like he's going to say something, and then steps back."nate, it's me, your mom," eileen whispers."i know who you are," nate replies quietly.he turns to me."you did this?""i think you should hear what she has to say.please, will you just sit for a minute?"nate's face twists into a sneer-an expression i haven't seen in weeks."you're unbelievable," he spits at me, and storms out the front door, slamming it behind him.eileen sits down with a muted cry, and i run after him."nate!"i call as i shut the door behind me and head down the front steps.he's walking around the side of the house, probably headed for the garage and his car to make an escape."would you just listen to me for a second?""why?so you can try to poison my mind against my dad some more?"he yells, reeling around."i'm trying to tell you the truth about him!eileen can tell you-" "oh, so this is all about you!you can try to paint it as some benevolent way of getting a mother and son to reunite, but really, this is all about getting me to believe your story," he turns again and begins to walk away across the grass."no!that's not true!"i protest, pursuing him."your mom is a good person-i wanted to help her, and you.""you're pathetic, you know that?"he says, spinning around again."stop following me.whatever mistakes we made together this summer, it's over.""what?nate, i-" i feel like he just punched me in the gut.how did this all go so wrong?"i thought maybe you were different than all the other girls i've fucked, but you're not, ok?from now on, let's just smile at each other politely from across the room at family events, like normal stepsiblings do.""no, no!we are different, we are.""you're just attached because i was your first.don't worry about it, you'll get over it soon.you were nothing special to me, brynn," he says and walks through the garage's side door.i stand in shock as i watch the garage door slide open and his wrangler come speeding out.i watch him head down the driveway, then disappear around the corner.i hear the front door open behind me, and eileen approach me."i'm so sorry, brynn, this is all my fault.""no, it's not," i reply, biting my lip to keep from sobbing.she puts her arm around me."he's just angry.he'll come to his senses.""no, he's just as stubborn as i am.it's really over."i collapse against her, burying my head on her shoulder as i begin to cry."first love always hits the hardest," she murmurs as she rubs my arm."come on-your parents won't be back for a while.i'll make you some tea."after eileen leaves and i've hidden away in my room, i can't help but marvel at her kindness.it's been a long time since my own mother has taken care of me and comforted me the way she did, even though the afternoon might have gone even worse for her than it did for me.she told me that she's learned not to get her hopes up for a reunion over the years, though it does still hurt.i keep picturing the anger on nate's face as he ended our romantic relationship.i could tell he really meant the things he was saying.my body aches at the thought that i won't get to touch him again, and feel him against me.already i feel like it's been ages since i've seen him.i hear my mom and pierce come home in the late afternoon, and i glance at my locked door.i don't want to see them now, or anytime soon, for that matter.i think of how nate begins to resemble his father when he gets angry, but his mother in his kindness.even though she was only in his life until he was eight or nine, she must have had some influence on him in those early years, in addition to whatever good traits she passed down to him genetically.i suppose i wanted to tip the scales in her direction, to make sure that nate keeps listening to the side of himself that his mother has passed on to him.but clearly, i don't have the power to make such a thing happen.mistake.he referred to what happened between us as a mistake.my body curls around myself as though i've just been punched in the gut.i can feel the pain reverberating in my bones.i thought maybe you were different than all the other girls i've fucked, but you're not.you're nothing special to me, brynn.his words keep echoing around in my head, and i can't make them go away.i don't know if i've ever felt so completely hollow before.eventually, i fall asleep, my body finally giving in to the exhaustion i feel.when i wake up, it's almost ten at night.my mom didn't even try to wake me for dinner, i realize.i feel a surge of anger against her.mothers are supposed to protect their children, but of course she's taking pierce's side.she thinks he's some kind of savior, rescuing her and her abandoned daughter from some lonely life.i want to scream.i want her to be stronger, to be there for me like i've been there for her countless times.but i know my anger is useless; i've long ago realized that i can't change her, can't expect her to be any different from the way that she is.my stomach grumbles, reminding me that i've skipped a meal or two today.i don't even feel like eating, but i know that i'll never be able to get to sleep again tonight without a little something in my stomach.i sigh and get out of bed and head over to my bureau, pulling a sweatshirt on over my t-shirt.i cautiously open my door and listen.i think i can just hear the sounds of the tv from my mom and pierce's room.should be safe, then.i tiptoe down the hallway, pausing at the open door to nate's dark room.still out, i guess.probably drinking somewhere.how long can this situation last?i wonder as i walk quietly down the stairs.i feel like we're all tightly-wound strings, and one of us is bound to break sometime.i know i for one can't keep creeping around the house like this, avoiding everyone.in the kitchen, i fix myself a grilled cheese sandwich, feeling the need for some comfort food.i'm just turning off the stove top when i hear the door to pierce's study open.i hurry to grab the spatula and slide the sandwich onto my plate before he comes in, but i'm too late."brynn," he says from the doorway."we missed you at dinner."ugh, that asshole, acting like nothing happened."just fixing something now," i answer shortly.as i put the spatula and pan into the sink, i see over my shoulder that he's walking toward me.he plants himself between the island and the fridge, trapping me by the counter."your mother is very upset," he tells me, his eyebrow bending into a concerned frown."is she?"i ask through gritted teeth.if he expects me to apologize, as though her mood is my fault, then he's mistaken."brynn, i think you've gotten the wrong idea about me," he murmurs, taking another step toward me.i reluctantly turn to face him."you have no idea how hard it is for a man, to have a beautiful woman like you in the house.""i'm your stepdaughter, pierce," i practically growl as my heartbeat jumps in my chest."you've really blossomed this summer, brynn.you've become a woman," he says, stepping into me.i can feel his warm breath on my face."i want you to get away from me," i whisper, my throat tightening."just for a moment... i need to feel..." he moans pitifully, sliding his hand onto my hip and then over my ass.my anger ignites at his touch, blasting away my fear.i get my arms up between us and shove him away."get off me, you fucking asshole!"i scream.he looks at me in shock."you think you're some gentleman with your fancy suits and your mansion, but inside you're just some sick pervert, taking advantage of anyone you can.i see who you really are, even if no one else does."his face twists with anger, and i feel my cheek light up with pain before my brain can process that he's slapped me.i bring my hand up to my burning face, my head still pulled to the side, just as pierce disappears in a blur.i straighten up with a gasp as i realize nate has just tackled him to the floor, and they are now grappling fiercely on the kitchen tiles."don't you fucking touch her!"he yells at his father, whose face is turning red in an effort to defend himself against his much stronger son.i hear footsteps from the stairwell and see my mom running down the hallway and manage to unfreeze myself."nate!nate, stop!"i yell, as he manages to find the top position.my mom screams as nate punches pierce hard across his jaw.i throw myself on nate's back as he cocks his arm back in preparation for another punch."nate, i'm ok, i'm ok," i repeat in his ear.i feel him relax a little and begin to pull him up.he drops his arm and stands up with me.pierce pushes him away as he stands up, too, and they face off, each breathing heavily, pierce with a trail of blood dripping from the corner of his mouth."what's going on?"my mom finally whispers, her voice full of fear."i saw everything," nate growls, addressing his father."you hypocrite."to my shock, pierce begins to laugh."i knew it, i knew it!look at you two!"he says, pointing at us."what's he talking about?"my mom asks, glancing at me."they're fucking!"pierce bursts out."no... what?"my mom murmurs."oh, christ, holly, are you really that fucking stupid?you didn't even suspect?"my mom shakes her head."that's why you're fighting?""no," nate says, turning to her."i saw him trying to feel up brynn, and then she told him to stop, and he slapped her."a look of horror spreads across my mom's face.she looks at me, then at pierce."is this true?is it true?"pierce doesn't even bother responding to her accusations, just turns his palms upward and shrugs.a wailing cry escapes my mom's lips.for a second i think she's going to collapse, but then she throws herself at pierce, her limbs a blur as she attacks him."i trusted you!i trusted you!"she screams.pierce puts his arms up to defend himself as nate steps forward and wraps his arms around her, hemming her in and then pulling her away."my own daughter!my own daughter, you son of a bitch!"with a strangled cry, she turns her head and begins to sob against nate's chest.pierce surveys the three of us, aligned against him on the other side of the kitchen."nothing?"nate whispers, as he rubs my mom's shoulder."you have nothing to say for yourself?""come on, nate.you're really going to believe them?"pierce says, a sneer of contempt on his face."i don't have to-i saw you with my own eyes.but i should have believed brynn in the first place," nate says quietly, though i can hear the strength in his voice.pierce can only manage a snort of derision before he walks toward the hallway."my mother," nate says, and pierce stops, his back still toward his son."you made everything up, didn't you?"pierce stands frozen for a moment, his head slightly cocked to the side.i can't see his face, and can't imagine what could be going on inside his mind.his carefully crafted history, now falling apart around him.he shakes his head slightly, as if waving away an unpleasant smell, then continues to walk down the hallway.he heads straight to the front door, and shuts it behind him.as we hear the sound of his car heading down the driveway, my mom straightens up, and nate's arms fall to his sides."i need to be alone for a little while," she murmurs, her gaze on the floor, and walks unsteadily toward the stairs.i watch her leave, wishing she had the strength to comfort me for even a moment."she's just in shock," nate says, reading my mind like always."i know," i reply with a nod, struggling to keep myself together."i should have believed you.""i had no reason to lie.""i know.i just couldn't believe he was capable of that kind of thing, or maybe i didn't want to believe.""you said some awful things to me today.god, was that just today?"i ask with a sad laugh, reaching up to rub my forehead."i'm so sorry, brynn.i was angry... sometimes my temper... i didn't mean any of those things.the time we've spent together-" he says, taking a step toward me."no, no.i'm not ready for that.i don't know if we can go back..." i murmur, a tear slipping down my face."brynn, please, i can't lose you.""you were so ready to turn on me," i whisper."so ready to push me away and be done with me.""i was in shock at seeing her again.i didn't actually mean it.""but you said it, didn't you?the way i care about you... i would never treat you that way, would never want you to hurt.but you wanted me to hurt.you don't feel the way about me that i feel about you.you can't.""that's not true!you have no idea how much i care about-" "i love you."there's a long silence.i stare up into his beautiful face, my heart shattering as he doesn't reply.he just looks back down at me, some unknowable emotion flickering across his eyes."well, there you go.there you go.goodbye, nate," i say, turning my back to him.he doesn't move."what are you going to do?"he finally asks quietly."um, well," i begin with a cold laugh."i think i'm going to eat this cold grilled cheese sandwich, and then i'm going to start packing."chapter twenty-seven i survey my mom's old beat-up station wagon.both the car and our old house were just on the verge of being sold, but my mom was able to back out.luckily she was taking her time in the process because she didn't think she had to worry about money anymore.the car isn't even full-the only things that belonged to us here were our clothes and some knick-knacks.it only took me a few hours this morning to pack it up.it's both sad and comforting.our old life is still waiting for us, almost as though this whole summer never happened.but of course it did.i wondered last night if i would take these last few months back if i could.if i were given a magic wand that could make it so that my mom had never met pierce, that i'd returned to our old house for the summer, that my relationship with nate had never gone beyond that encounter in the crew house, would i wave it?i don't know if i've ever felt so much pain as i have recently, but also never so much happiness.i was held in such a tight little shell before, never really experiencing the depths or heights of anything, and i suppose you can't have one without the other.to never have held nate in my arms... no, i can't imagine it.despite so many terrible things having happened, i would never want to erase the time i spent with him, even if it would take away the pain i'm feeling right now.the pain that i can feel even in my bones, causing a throbbing ache throughout my whole body.it's like i'm detoxing from some powerful, addictive substance.one that i know only hurts me in the end.i catch a glimpse of my slightly swollen lip in the car window from where pierce hit me last night.we haven't seen him today-he must be holed up at a friend's house or a hotel.i don't even want to think of the divorce proceedings that my mom will be wrapped up in now.i hear the front door shut behind me and turn-will it be nate coming to say goodbye?but it's my mom, carrying one last small suitcase, her eyes covered in large, round sunglasses."ready?"she asks, without looking at me.i nod, then remember one last thing i've forgotten."i'll be right back," i say, and hurry in through the front door without explanation.i walk straight up the staircase and down the hall into my bedroom.it looks exactly the same as the first time i saw it.i pause for a moment, taking in the beauty of the furnishings for the last time, before walking over to my desk and opening the top drawer.i reach my arm all the way to the back and fish out the small slip of paper i stashed there.i walk out and down the hallway.nate's bedroom door is slightly open and i can tell from the silence that he's not inside.i push it open all the way and walk to his bed.i run my hand over his bedspread and breathe in his smell.i pull down the comforter and lay the piece of paper on top of his pillow, then pull the comforter back up over it.i certainly don't want pierce to find the scrap of paper where eileen wrote her phone number.i'm about to leave when something makes me cross over to his window overlooking the river.my eye catches on a flash of white on the lower lawn : nate sitting on the top step of the stairs leading down to the rocky shore.he sits completely still, his white t-shirt stretched across his broad back.i resist the urge to wonder what he'll do now-it's really none of my business anymore.i hurry back down to the car and see my mom sitting in the passenger seat.i open the driver's door and see that she's placed the keys on the seat.i get in without a word and turn the car on then pull away from the house.i glance in the rearview mirror to get one last glimpse at it as i turn the corner out of the gate.my mom is silent on our drive back to our old house, just staring out the window as we get on the highway that takes us further away from the city, back to our much less expensive neighborhood.a seed of resentment that's been building inside of me all summer, or perhaps longer, finally takes root as i glance sidelong at her impassive face."you haven't even looked at me all day," i finally say, gripping the steering wheel with white-knuckled hands."what do you mean?"she asks faintly, still not turning to me."you haven't looked at my face," i repeat."brynn..." she sighs."no, it's true.your husband slapped me last night and you never even came to check on me.and now you won't look at the bruise.""brynn, i've been very upset.""and i haven't?he feels me up, hits me, and you haven't asked me if i'm ok." "it's not my fault that he did those things!"she shouts, suddenly hysterical."mom, i'm not blaming you for his actions, alright?but you're my mother.you should have believed me-you should have taken care of me.i've been taking care of you for years, and this time, i needed you."my mom sobs once, reaching up to cover her mouth with her hand."i wanted to believe you, brynn, i really did," she finally gasps."i just knew that if i did, everything would fall apart, and it all seemed so perfect.""but it wasn't.""no, it wasn't."i feel her hand reach up tentatively to touch my face, and her fingers graze over the small cut in the corner of my mouth."oh, i'm so sorry, my darling.does it hurt much?""hardly at all," i reply, swallowing the tears that have sprung up at her touch."i never guessed... about you and nate, i mean," she whispers."that's over, too," i reply shortly as my emotions threaten to overwhelm me."ah," is all she says."well, i know that might not be the kind of thing you ever want to talk about with your mother, but i'm here.you cared about him a lot?""yes," i answer, my voice raspy with held emotion."so i guess you have to get a lawyer?"i ask, changing the subject."oh, god.i suppose so," she replies."i think i'll be able to get my old job at the salon back, at least.i talked to anita and she said the new girl they got is terrible.""did you sign a pre-nup?"i ask, thinking of eileen.i know i'll have to fill my mom in on what i know about her soon, but it would just be too much for me right now."yes," she sighs."iron-clad."chapter twenty-eight i close the door behind me and dump my newly-purchased textbooks on my thin mattress, then straighten up to survey my lawn room.it's not much to look at, with its sparse furnishings and lack of bathroom access, though it does have a framed list of every inhabitant that's lived here, going back to uva's very first class.for the last month, i've just been sitting around our old house, doing my best to help my mom with getting her old job back and hiring a lawyer, but there really wasn't much for me to do.i felt both relief and fear when it was finally time to drive back down to charlottesville.relief because i'll have schoolwork to occupy my mind, and fear because i might run into nate on campus.foolishly, i had hoped that he would try to get in touch with me after my mom and i moved out, but he didn't.it really was stupid of me.i told him that i loved him, and he didn't say it back.simple as that.even though he was angry, there must have been some truth to his words when he told me i wasn't special to him.i glance at the clock.just after four-almost time for my dinner shift in the cafeteria to be starting.i change into my work clothes and head over.at least i know i won't run into nate there-the athletes all have a separate dining hall serving far tastier and more nutritious food.i open my door to the lawn, smiling halfheartedly at another female student a few doors down as she exits her room at the same time.i walk quickly, keeping my head down, not really wanting to interact with anyone i know.i enter the dining hall and cross around to the side door, back into the kitchen."oh, brynn!"roberta, my manager, waves to me from a table by the front, where she's doing some paperwork.i wave back and head over."there's been some issue with your work-study," she tells me quietly as i reach her."an issue?"i ask frowning."do you know what it is?""something related to your scholarship-that's all the dean's office told me when they called."i rub my forehead in frustration.this is the last thing i need."if you head over to monroe hall now, you might be able to talk to someone who knows more than i do."i nod."sorry," she adds, before continuing with her work.i hurry out of the dining hall and follow roberta's advice to see if i can get some more answers, though i fear i already know what happened.my mom has been so frazzled lately, i bet she forgot to make a payment on the portion of the tuition that we still owe.i explain the situation to a secretary at monroe, who points me toward the office in charge of the work-study program.a man in his early thirties stands to greet me as i walk through the open door of his office."francis delton," he introduces himself, shaking my hand."how can i help you?""well, i was told there's some issue with my work-study program, or with my scholarship, or something," i reply, reaching to tug at my hair before realizing it's pulled up in a ponytail."ok, your name?"he asks, sitting down and motioning me into the chair across from him."brynn atwell," i respond, spelling it out for him.he types my name into his computer and then clicks around for a moment."ah, this is quite unusual," he says, raising his eyebrows at his screen."ok..." i reply nervously."you can no longer participate in the work-study program, because your tuition has been paid in full."i stare at him."you mean, for this semester?""no, i mean all of your tuition."i shake my head, unable to believe him."for this year?or... i mean, not all all?"he smiles."all all.""but that's... that's impossible.how?who?"i stammer."i have no idea.i can only see that you're ineligible for the program.""ok, ok," i reply, trying to gather my thoughts."thank you.thank you so much."i wander out of his office and out onto the quad.with pierce and my mom getting divorced, i knew i'd have college tuition loans to deal with again, and i took it in stride.i was used to the idea, anyway.what the hell's going on?i reach into my back pocket and dial my mom.i have no idea if she'll know either, but i can at least tell her the good news."oh, brynn!brynn, i was just going to call you!"she says as she picks up."let me guess, is it about my tuition?"i ask, hearing excitement in her voice."yes!how did you know?""well, i showed up for my shift at the dining hall, and was told that my tuition's been taken care of.what's going on?""i was literally just picking up the phone to tell you... it all happened so quickly this afternoon.pierce's lawyer offered me a settlement in the divorce!and it specifically included payment of your tuition.""pierce paid my tuition?"i ask, my mind reeling."yes!as soon as i signed, the money was wired over.""but... but mom, was it a good settlement?i mean, did you have a lawyer look it over?""yeah, it was the same lawyer who told me i'd get nothing because of the pre-nup i signed.he was completely floored, and told me i'd better sign before pierce changes his mind.""but... why?i mean, it seems so out of character for him.""i know!i can hardly believe it either.it's crazy!i'll be able to pay off the mortgage on the house and have a little left over.i mean, we're not rich or anything, but we have a bit of leeway now.""was it, you know,'hush money,' do you think?""i doubt it.the lawyer said that there's no less reliable witness than a woman trying to defame her ex-husband, so i don't really think pierce would be worried about me going to the press with stories or anything-not that i'd want to do that anyway.but honey, it's done now.it's really over.we don't have to worry about him anymore.""well, i'm glad that you're happy with it.if you're happy i'm happy.man, this is the first good news we've gotten in a while, huh?"i touch my lips with my fingertips, wondering when the last time i smiled was."have you seen him yet?"my mom asks quietly.she doesn't need to specify that she's referring to nate."not yet," i reply."though i've convinced myself that every brown-haired guy i've seen from the back is him.""that's normal," my mom assures me."you'll see him everywhere for a while.but it will pass soon, my darling.i promise."chapter twenty-nine realizing i now have the evening off, i take a deep breath and call allison.i'm still in a daze, but i want to share my good fortune with her and miriam.allison and i haven't talked since our argument over the summer, so i'm relieved when she accepts my invitation on behalf of both of them.i pick a rather fancy restaurant, and assure her that it's my treat.half an hour later, i'm walking out of my room in a light summer dress-the weather here in virginia is still sweltering, even though it's september.i walk slowly across the quad to the off-campus restaurant, trying not to work up a sweat.i watch a group of freshmen girls giggling as they head out for a group dinner.new hall mates, no doubt.i remember how nervous i was my first year here, worrying that i wouldn't make any more friends than i did in high school.my insides contract as i pass the spot where i first saw nate crossing the grass, just a couple weeks into my freshman year.i shake my head at myself.i have to forget him.when i reach the restaurant, an upscale mexican place known for its flavored margaritas, i'm relieved to feel the ac hit me.the hostess smiles at me just as i see allison sitting in a booth by herself.she stands with a nervous smile and i walk over."i hope you don't mind," she murmurs as we hug awkwardly."i sort of lied to miriam and told her you pushed back dinner by fifteen minutes so we'd have a chance to talk."a short bark of laughter escapes my mouth."i don't know if i've ever heard you lie before."to my surprise, she blushes as we sit down across from each other."well, i've been thinking about what you said... about my being judgmental... and maybe i am a bit of, you know, a goody two-shoes.maybe i need to loosen up a little.what i'm trying to say is, i'm sorry for what i said."i reach over and place my hand over hers."thanks.it means a lot to hear you say that.i've hated not talking to you.""me too," she replies.i see her glance over my shoulder."and here i thought i was early!"i hear miriam say.i stand up to give her a hug."i see you two have synced your watches, being in the same city together all summer!ugh, i was so jealous!"she sits down with a dramatic sigh in the booth next to allison, her bright red hair falling onto her shoulder."so.catch me up on everything that's been happening."to my horror, i begin to tear up."oh, god, sorry," i murmur, reaching for a napkin."what's wrong?"allison gasps.the waiter walks over and is about to ask for our drink orders but they wave him away."it's... it's..." i grab a napkin to hide my face and try to take deep breaths."is it a boy?"miriam guesses.i nod."nate.""wait, wait... not your stepbrother?"she asks incredulously.allison glances at me and i nod at her.she turns to miriam."they started, you know, seeing each other over the summer... but i guess something happened," she fills miriam in."long story short," i say, catching my breath."pierce is a jerk, our parents got divorced, and we broke up.""wow," miriam breathes, her eyes wide."you had quite the summer.""tell me about it," i say with a wry smile."i could really use a drink."allison flags down the waiter, and by the time our first round has arrived, my tears have stopped."so, can i tell you guys my own secret?"miriam asks, leaning over the table conspiratorially.allison and i nod."i had sex!""oh, god, now i'm the only virgin," allison moans."how was it?""honestly... not that great the first time.but the third time, i think i had an orgasm," miriam whispers."you think?"allison asks, cocking her head in confusion."yeah, i think.what about you, brynn?""what?""did you and nate..." she trails off suggestively."um, yes.""and?"allison leans forward.my heartbeat quickens at the memory of his touch before sadness washes over me.i shake my head."i'd rather not think about it."i finish the rest of the dinner trying to engage in the conversation, but knowing that i'm often forcing the smile on my face.allison and miriam do their best to raise my spirits, and i try to act excited about classes starting on monday, but my mind, and my heart, aren't quite in it.after i pay the bill, allison and miriam volunteer to walk me back to my room, but i demur, feeling like a walk by myself before bed.after i hug them goodbye, i stroll along the edge of campus, watching all the action unfold as everyone enjoys the last weekend free of homework.it's not long before i realize my feet are leading me past the crew house.just a quick look, i tell myself.i begin to walk more slowly as i see it up the street.the lights are on inside the house, and i can see some people hanging out on the front porch.the late summer night has just darkened, and i stand under a street light peering up at the house.i can see several of the crew guys up there, and a petite blonde leaning on the railing with her back toward me.the front door swings open and i press my lips together as i see nate walk out with two bottles of beer in his hand.he's so close... just across the street and up the hill, and yet i can't be with him, this person with whom i've shared such intimate moments.my heart stops as he smiles at the blonde.it can't be... he can't have moved on already.but there he is, offering her one of the beers, and sitting down next to her on the railing and wrapping an arm around her shoulders.a chill comes over me despite the warm air.i really am a fool.i jump as a bottle crashes on a campus path just behind me.i glance up to see the denizens of the porch also looking at the source of the sound, and freeze for a moment as nate stares right at me.fuck.i turn around, cursing myself for walking this way.i walk quickly down the street, turning right onto a path to take me into campus."brynn?"i hear him call out behind me, and the sound of footsteps coming down the steps.i pick up my pace, hoping to lose him in the darkness.i can't let our first meeting after breaking up be him finding me spying on his house."brynn!"i hear a woman's voice yell behind me, and almost trip over my own feet in surprise."brynn!"she calls again, and i turn around."eileen," i say in surprise as she emerges out of the darkness, slightly out of breath."was... was that you up there?with nate?"she nods, a wide smile covering her face.my eyes dart over his shoulder as i see nate stop by the entrance to the path."i'm down here visiting him for the weekend," she says happily."oh, oh," i murmur, covering my face in embarrassment."i'm sorry i ran... i thought... i mean, from the back, i thought you and he were..." "oh!"she exclaims."well, i suppose i'm flattered... i mean, i do put my time in at the gym."she steps forward and takes my hands."i'm so glad to see you brynn.if you hadn't gotten involved, i wouldn't be here with nate today."i try to blink back tears, but they roll down my cheeks anyway."i'm so sorry for everything you've been through-nate told me-" "mom?"nate says, stepping forward."mind if i talk to brynn alone for a minute?""of course!"she calls over her shoulder, then turns to me."it's so nice to hear him call me'mom,"' she says, then leans forward and whispers in my ear, "don't give up hope."i blink at her in surprise as she pulls away and walks back toward nate.they share a smile and a few murmured words before she continues back toward the crew house and nate approaches me."hi," he murmurs as he walks up to me."hello," i reply, a bit more stiffly."i found her number where you left it," he explains."we met several times while i was still up in maryland, but it hardly seemed like enough time, so she drove me back down here and is staying for a few days."he takes a deep breath."when you told me you loved me-" i raise my hand to stop him."you don't have to explain.you told me from the beginning that you didn't do relationships... that you didn't lead girls on.so i should have known.i shouldn't have expected-" "brynn, please.just give me two minutes, ok?"i nod, shifting from foot to foot as i wish i could just run away, all the way back to my room and pull the covers over my head.anything so that i don't have to hear all the reasons why he doesn't love me."when you told me you loved me," he resumes, "i felt empty."tears spring to my eyes-oof, that was worse than i thought."no, not like that!"he says, seeing my reaction."i mean, i felt... Inadequate.like i had nothing inside me to give back to you.here you were, so strong, and smart, and intelligent, and i felt like such a failure."i'm shocked to hear his voice break.he clears his throat before he continues."i had failed you.i felt...i mean, everything my dad had ever told me was a lie!"he exclaims, his voice rising."in that moment, i don't think i knew if i was capable of love.what my father had shown me for years wasn't love, i don't think, it was control.i felt so undeserving to be loved by you, and for me to even tell you that i loved you, it wouldn't mean anything, because it would be from someone who was empty.""you're not empty," i murmur, unable to hear him talk about himself like this even though he broke my heart."i'm starting to realize that.it's been good, seeing my mom, talking to her, hearing the truth about my past.all the things that you were trying to help me with.you were right all along.""i wasn't trying to be right.""i know, that's not-sorry, this is coming out all wrong.i've been thinking about you every day, imagining us meeting up back on campus, and it's just happened a lot quicker than i thought it would.i wanted to call you every day, but i needed to make sure i was ready.that i had done some work on myself before i tried to reach out to you.i know the kind of relationship i want to have with you, and i want to make sure i'm ready for it."i blink at him, feeling confused."so, what are you saying?""i'm saying that you're not my stepsister anymore, first of all," he says with a small grin."they filed today.""you talked to your dad?""just once.i couch-surfed with friends after you left.i didn't want to stay in the same house with him."i stare at him as a realization begins to trickle through my brain."it was you, wasn't it?you got him to give my mom a settlement."he runs a hand through his hair."well, after talking with my mom, and hearing what happened to her in their divorce, i was worried he wouldn't be fair in dealing with your mom either.so, i, um, told him that if he ever wanted to see me again, he'd have to give your mom some money in the divorce.and your tuition, well, i figured after what he put you through, that you deserved it.""i can't believe you did that.""actually, i wasn't sure it would work.i mean, i wasn't sure if he wanted to see me again anyway.""i think, in his own twisted way, he does love you.""his very twisted way."he steps forward and reaches for my hand, which is still entwined in my hair.he pulls it down and laces his fingers through mine."i can't promise you that i'll know how to be in a normal relationship right away, but please, give me another chance.i know how badly i fucked up, but i want to do better.please.i want to learn with you."i pause, uncertain.can i really put myself out there with him?risk my heart being broken again?i feel him begin to pull my hand gently behind his back so that i'm forced to take a step in.he leans forward, tucking my arm against the small of his back."no fair," i whisper, as the heat of his body envelopes me.he wraps his other arm around me."i know," he says with a sly grin."but can you blame me?i'd do anything for another chance with you."everything about him is so intoxicating.i'm dizzy with desire for him after not being near him for close to a month.i turn my face up to his."ok, ok," i relent."one more chance."the words have barely left my lips when he covers my mouth with his.my legs almost give out as we touch-a mix of pleasure and relief overwhelming my body."god, i've missed you," he murmurs, breaking away for a moment.i pull his head back down to mine and sink my tongue into his mouth."get a room!"we break away as a group of guys, probably freshmen, walk past us, hooting and hollering.nate glares at them for a moment, then rolls his eyes."come on, there's something i've wanted to do for a long time anyway."he leads me by the hand back out of campus and across the street to the crew house.i'm wondering if he means something sexual, and worries he forgot his mom is visiting him.we walk up the steps and i see her and the crew guys turn to us as we step onto the porch."everyone, this is my girlfriend, brynn," he announces proudly.chapter thirty eileen's face breaks into a huge grin as i blush.his teammates slap him on the back and needle him about his lack of previous relationships, then begin to introduce themselves to me.i'm quickly offered a beer and pulled into multiple conversations, but nate is there every few minutes with a hand on my back, making sure i'm ok. as the night goes on, the porch fills up with more people, and, particularly, more women.i'm happily overwhelmed by all these new faces, but also glad to just lean on the railing for a minute to sip my beer."brynn?"i hear a woman's voice call.i turn to see cara walking up onto the porch."hey!"i say, and stand up to give her a hug."how was your summer?""um..." i murmur, unable to find the words to describe the last few months.i look over her shoulder and watch a girl i don't know place her hand on nate's chest.before i can even frown, though, he steps back and smiles politely, then makes his way over to me."it was pretty crazy," is all i can come up with before nate's arm snakes his way around my waist."i just saw my mom yawning, so i think she's about to go back to her hotel," he says."oh, hey cara.""nate... are you two...?"cara asks, her eyes darting back and forth between us."we are," i confirm, as nate grins down at me.it does feel good to say it out loud."and you've already met his parents?wow!""yeah, we've met," i reply a bit evasively, as nate bites his lip to keep from laughing.i elbow him in the ribs."we better go say goodbye to his mom."sure enough, eileen is shouldering her purse and looking around as we walk over."i hope i didn't take up too much of your time with nate tonight," i say as we walk up."not at all.i wouldn't be here at all if it weren't for you," she says, wrapping me up in a big hug."will you join us for brunch tomorrow before i head back home?"i glance at nate, who's looking at me encouragingly."i'd love to.""great, i'll see you tomorrow then!"she says, giving nate a hug before walking down the steps."is it weird that i want to be friends with your mom?"i ask him as we watch her get into her car."not weirder than sleeping with your stepbrother," he murmurs wickedly in my ear."you think you've had enough of this party?"i shiver at the implication of his words."i think so."he nods over his shoulder toward the front door of the house and i follow him inside.the living room has several people in it now, but he continues up the steps and to his bedroom down the hall."there isn't going to be another girl under your covers, is there?"i ask him teasingly as he opens the door.he turns to me with a grin."only you now, brynn."he wraps his arms around my waist and pulls me across the threshold, shutting the door behind me and then pressing me up against it.my body lights up with desire as his mouth covers mine and he pulls my arms over my head, keeping them pinned to the door with one hand over my wrists.i feel his other hand pulling up the hem of my summer dress as his legs push between mine."alright if this one's a little quick?"he asks, nibbling on my ear."i just want to feel you," i breathe, arching my back and pressing my breasts onto his chest.with a grunt, he pulls away, reaching into his pocket.i pull my dress over my head as he yanks his zipper down and pushes his boxers and khakis to his knees, rolling the condom over his length.i barely manage to get my panties to the floor when he steps back into me, grabbing my ass and hoisting me up.i moan as i feel his tip press against my opening.i must have tightened up a bit in the time we've spent apart because there's a shot of pain as he slides me down his shaft.i wrap my arms around the back of his neck and lock my ankles just above his ass as he leans me back against the door."oh fuck," he murmurs as he reaches his depth inside me.he circles his hips, letting me feel him inside me at every angle before pulling back out again.i marvel at his strength as he's able to hold me in place and thrust in and out of me with almost no support from me.the pain is gone by just his third thrust, and pleasure begins to course through my veins.my toes curl and i run my hands through his hair, then lean forward and slide my tongue inside his mouth.to my surprise, he steps away from the door, wrapping one arm around my back to keep me supported.he sinks down onto the edge of his bed so that i'm sitting on top of him.i unlock my ankles and move my legs so that i'm kneeling on the mattress.i rise up onto my knees as he leans back on his hands, getting used to the feeling of riding him.i reach my arms back, bringing my hands to the top of his thighs as i slide down him, feeling him stretching me open.he's hitting me in all the right places and i begin to move faster and faster.i keep my eyes open, watching as his mouth drops open and his jaw clenches.i love seeing that i'm pushing him right to the edge even as an orgasm is quickly building inside of me.his hips begin to pick up off the bed, slamming into me as i sink down.the extra power is just what i need, and i feel myself explode on top of him just as he begins to cry out.i keep rising up and down as i come, feeling how slick i am inside.he pulls me tight against him, resting his head between my breasts, as we both take deep, gasping breaths.but he's not done yet.i feel his hands creep up to my bra strap, unhooking it and sliding it down my arms.even though i'm exhausted, i lean back and lift up my arms so he can slide it all the way off.he tosses it onto a nearby chair then sighs and runs his fingers down my neck, across my clavicle, then down my shoulders."i missed you," he murmurs kissing me softly in the middle of my chest.i bend my head down and kiss his hairline, then reach down and tug at his shirt.he obediently lifts his arms up so i can slide it off."mm," i mutter as i lean forward against him, relishing the skin-to-skin contact.suddenly i feel him lift me up and turn me around, depositing me with my back on the bed.he reaches down to hold the condom on as he pulls out of me, grabbing a tissue from his side table and finally kicking his pants and underwear all the way off.he slides back next to me on the bed as i glance around his room.it's neat in here, as i'd expect, except for floor-to-ceiling shelves next to his metal desk that are overflowing with textbooks."had to have them put in," he says, seeing me looking at them."but i'll give you the tour later."i feel his hand slide over my hips, pulling me toward him.that hand slowly inches down as his tongue slides against mine, now working slowly, his urgency gone.he groans as he feels the wetness between my legs and slides one finger inside me.his thumb just grazes my clit and i gasp, pressing back against him."do i still get to order you around in bed?""yes, please," i whimper, closing my eyes as he begins to circle his thumb."good," he murmurs, and his fingers pull away, but are immediately replaced by his mouth.i moan as he takes a long lick of me, pulling my legs apart and repositioning his body between them.he holds my knees out wide, opening me to him completely.his tongue moves down to my opening, darting in and out of me-such a different sensation than his fingers or his cock.as he moves up again to my clit, flicking his tongue mercilessly back and forth across it, i feel another orgasm begin to pool deep in my belly."wait, wait, come here," i say, touching his hand on my knee."i want to taste you, too."he looks up at me with a grin, and sits up.i press my legs together and he works his way up my body on his knees.i pin my arms to my sides as he comes up and kneels on either side of my shoulders.i pick up my head and he takes his hard cock in his hand, placing it between my lips.i can taste the latex of the condom we just used, mixed with both of our own scents."fuck, brynn," he growls as he slowly presses his hips forward until his cock hits the back of my throat.he begins to move a little faster, but he's careful not to overwhelm me, knowing that i'm completely helpless under him.i keep my eyes on his face as sweat begins to break out on his brow and his neck muscles tense.with a groan, he pulls out of my mouth."turn over," he orders me as he swings one leg over me so that i can follow his command.i obey, feeling my breasts squish against the plain blue comforter.i hear the rip of another condom and a moment later he lies down on top of me, sweeping my hair off the back of my neck as he does so.i feel his breath on my ear as his cock pushes inside me.i'm so wet and he drives deep inside-maybe it's the position, but i don't know if i've ever felt him so deep before.he pulls out and moves back in slowly, eliciting a long cry from me.i feel tears spring to my eyes at the intensity of the sensation."squeeze your legs together," he whispers.i inch them together, feeling my muscles clench even more tightly around his dick.his legs are on either side of me now, and i can feel that he has more traction as he thrusts in harder now.his tongue finds my ear and my body begins to shake as his tongue flicks inside me.i hear myself begin to moan as though it's coming from someone else, though i also feel completely at one with my body and his."yes, yes, fuck," he grunts on top of me."come with me, come with me!"i have no choice but to obey again, unraveling beneath him as he releases himself inside me.after a few final strokes, i feel him let go of his weight, relaxing on top of me.his nose nuzzles into the side of my cheek, his lips just finding the edge of my mouth to give me a kiss."you know what the best part is?"he whispers."mm?"i murmur back, my tired brain unable to follow his train of thought."you can stay the night."epilogue "man, i'm glad this place has central air," i say, setting down the last of the boxes in our new apartment.i'm sweating even with it on, and use the bottom of my t-shirt to wipe my forehead."yeah, i thought boston was supposed to be cooler than virginia," nate says, shaking his head with a smile as he hoists a box onto the counter as though it weighed nothing, though i know for a fact it has our heavy dishes in it.we flew up here for a weekend last month to find an apartment, and were quite lucky that this charlestown two-bedroom was just our third stop.the realtor described the neighborhood as "up-and-coming," and nate loved the cozy feel and exposed brick.neither of us start our jobs in town for another week, but i'm glad we came early.we have all the unpacking to do, we still need a lot of furniture... "are you going to get tired of me?"nate asks, walking over and wrapping his arms around my waist."living together, you mean?absolutely.are you going to get sick of me?""absolutely," he says, nodding seriously, then he grins."i love you.""i love you, too," i reply as he leans in to kiss me.once such a big deal for him to say, nate now tells me he loves me regularly.i squirm happily as his tongue darts quickly against mine.a year later, and his kisses still make me weak in the knees."what's that box?"i ask as he releases me and i glance over his shoulder."which?"he asks, looking around."there," i say, pointing to a medium-sized box sitting where we plan to put the couch, when we get one."dunno," he says with a shrug."clothes?""mm, no, i don't think so," i reply, walking over to it and picking it up."it's really light."i shake it and can just hear the crinkling of paper."that's weird."i set it back down on the floor and kneel next to it, scratching at the corner of the packing tape sealing it shut.i finally get enough up to get my finger under it, and pull it across the boxes flaps.nick comes to stand near me as i pull it open."i really don't remember packing this one, but maybe i'm going crazy."it has been an eventful week.we graduated last weekend, and played host to both of our moms, and then just a few days later we were driving up to boston.we both managed to secure jobs here, nate with a historical society, and me in the research side of a non-profit.i pull the brown packing paper out of the box, piling it on the floor next to me."oh dear, did i pack an empty box?"i ask, just as my fingers close around a much smaller box at the bottom of the larger one."what's..." my eyes widen as i realize i'm holding a jewelry box.i glance up at nate, who's grinning at me.he kneels down onto the hardwood floor next to me."oh my god," i murmur, as he takes the small box out of my hands.of course we've discussed marriage, but i didn't think he would propose so soon."brynn," he whispers, "i've come alive since i met you.my world before you came into it was cold and dark, and then you showed up and brought light into it.every day, i find a new reason to fall more in love with you.i know we're still young, but i want so much to have the honor of calling you my wife.will you marry me?"he asks, opening the box.i stare at the simple, beautiful diamond ring sitting in the middle of the red velvet box as my eyes fill with tears."yes, yes, of course i'll marry you," i gasp, wrapping my arms around his neck and covering him with kisses.he laughs joyously and lifts me off the ground with his free arm."here, try it on," he finally says."i measured your ring finger while you were sleeping.""sneaky!"i tease him as he slips the ring on my hand."it's a perfect fit," i say, holding it toward the nearest window so the light catches it."should we call your mom?"he asks, wrapping his arms back around my waist."let's wait until tomorrow.for today, only you and i will know.""only you," he echoes, pressing his forehead against mine."only you."the end chapter one "i thought you said this was going to be a small gathering," i shout, raising my voice above the blaring music.i can feel the pounding bass line vibrating through my body as i hesitate at the edge of the gigantic house party."did i say that?"my best friend, riley, grins back."i meant to say that this was going to be an'epic rager unlike anything you've ever seen'."i roll my eyes at her as we're swallowed up by the teeming crowd of our classmates.i should have known better than to think that riley would spend her saturday night anywhere but at a legendary party.she and i have been best friends for all seventeen years we've been on the planet.but even so, our ideas of what makes a "good time" are starkly different.if i had any sense at all, i would never have let her drag me to this party.i'd much rather be curled up at home with my sketch pad and a cup of tea.but seeing that the damage is done, i suppose there's nothing to do but try and have a good time."here you go ladies," a burly junior boy says, sidling up to us with a red plastic cup in either hand."first drink's on me.""warm beer, now with extra roofies?"riley says, cocking a perfect eyebrow at him."we're all set, champ," i tell the boy, producing a flask full of my dad's very fine whiskey from my purse.it's not like he's using it much, these days."better luck next time.""what a couple of buzz kills," the kid grumbles, sulking away."great party so far ri," i laugh sarcastically, unscrewing the top of the flask."just remember, abby-in less than a year, we'll never have to deal with high school boys again," she points out, accepting the flask as i pass it her way."i can't wait," i say wistfully, "i know you're not supposed to wish away your youth or whatever, but the sooner high school can be over with, the better.""what?you're not enjoying your glory days?"riley asks with mock astonishment, gesturing toward our fellow partygoers.i look around at the party unfolding all around us.some rich kid's parents are out of town, and the entire school has descended on their mcmansion to spend the night getting wasted, listening to someone's crappy ipod playlist, and making questionable choices about who to sleep with.i nearly step on two people going at it right in the foyer, writhing all over each other in a drunken tizzy.with a wild yell, some kid tries to swing on the crystal chandelier, only to miss and fall flat on his face to onlookers' uproarious laughter."if these are our glory days," i say to riley, "we're in serious trouble.""come on," she laughs, slipping her fingers through mine, "i'm sure we can find a quieter corner somewhere.there must be, like, a hundred rooms in this place."i let riley tug me off through the party, ignoring the tipsy dudes who make lesbian jokes about us along the way.as gorgeous as my best friend is, with her silky black curls, tanned skin, and amazing curves, i've never been the least bit interested in "experimenting" with her.we've only ever loved each other as sisters.but the fact that i've never had a real boyfriend leads some people in my school to question whether i'm into guys at all.the short answer is, i'm plenty into guys.but finding one that's worth the time of day at my connecticut high school has proven to be impossible.well... just about impossible, anyway.the party is just a forest of legs and torsos from my vantage point.at five foot three, i'm what you might call "vertically challenged".being petite is great for hide-and-seek, but not so great for feeling like anything close to an adult.or being treated like one.but in a couple weeks' time, the world will have no choice but to acknowledge my adulthood-at long last, i'll finally be turning eighteen.the only question that remains is how quickly i can get out of town and be on my own once i'm officially a grown-up.as riley and i climb the sweeping staircase and sidle into the master bedroom suite, we pass a passed out classmate who's had his face graffitied with permanent marker penises.yep.adulthood can't come soon enough.we poke our heads into the master bedroom, and i note with relief that it's far quieter in this corner of the house.maybe we can just hang out here and ride out this shit show in peace."uh-oh," riley mutters, glancing down at me with a wicked glint in her eye."look who's here, abby."i peer around my best friend, scanning the dozen or so people already hanging out in the master bedroom.it only takes half a second for me to see who it is she's talking about.my solar plexus rocks on its axis as a very familiar set of blue eyes turns my way from across the room."shit!"i squeak, ducking back around riley's taller form."i didn't know he was going to be here!""the entire school is here, abby," riley laughs, "you could have guessed.""he's supposed to be too cool for this sort of thing.or whatever," i say, rolling my hazel eyes."come on.i don't think he saw me.let's just go-" "hey, sis!"a rough baritone calls from across the room."what are you doing here?isn't it past your bedtime?"i groan as a volley of chuckles goes up around the room, and turn to see emerson sawyer, my blue-eyed nightmare, striding toward me.he's easily six feet tall, with broad shoulders, a tapered torso, and effortlessly defined muscles.his mop of shaggy, chestnut brown hair is artfully tousled, a stray lock swooping across his forehead.he's making jeans and a crimson tee shirt look as good as a three piece suit, and has a lit cigarette cradled in his full, firm lips.naturally, my personal nightmare looks like an absolute dream come true."don't call me that in public.or ever," i tell him, crossing my arms to hide the fact that my heart is slamming against my ribcage at his approach."why not, sis?"he grins rakishly, taking a long drag of his smoke."because it's creepy as hell," i reply, exasperated, tucking my long, ash blonde hair behind my ears."and it's not even true.""sure it is.for all intents and purposes," he shrugs.i've known emerson sawyer for nearly four years, now.or, rather, i've known of him for four years.our connecticut town has two elementary schools that feed into the same high school.emerson and i attended separate grade schools, which were pretty starkly divided between the richer and poorer families in town, but ended up at the same high school together.i noticed him the very first day of freshman year, when he mouthed off to our sex ed teacher for taking a hard line in favor of abstinence ( the most characteristically emerson thing ever ).he, on the other hand, had no idea i existed.until this year, that is, when both of our lives-personal and social-got turned upside down."what's the matter?you ashamed to have a brother from the wrong side of the tracks?"emerson presses, jostling me out of my thoughts."don't put that on me," i snap back, "as if you can stand having a prissy rich girl for a would-be-sister.""you are kind of a bummer," he says flatly, "but if it makes you feel any better, it's your personality i hold against you, not your money."i stare wordlessly at emerson, knocked into sullen silence once again by his masterful putdown.by now, but emerson has figured out exactly how to get to me.about two months ago, i got the shock of my life when my widower father, robert rowan, announced that, after four years of refusing to date, he had just met the new love of his life.her name was deborah, he told me.they'd met at aa and "really hit it off".he talked about her incessantly, stayed out all night like he was a teenager again, and generally weirded the hell out of me.after just two weeks, dad told me that he was in love, and wanted to introduce this deborah to me as soon as possible.i begrudgingly agreed to be around for dinner the following night to meet his mystery woman.we lost my mother sandy to a terrible car accident just before i started high school, so the idea of a new woman in my father's life was a little hard to swallow.still, i did my best to put on a happy face and be as supportive as possible.i've never been very good at saying "no" or standing up to my dad, so it's not like i had much of a choice.as our doorbell rang the next night, signaling deborah's grand entrance into our family's life, my dad asked me to answer the door.it wasn't until i was en route that he mentioned deborah's son would also be joining us for dinner.when i swung open the door to welcome our guest and her plus one, i'm surprised that my jaw didn't crack from hitting the floor so hard.there, standing on my doorstep, was emerson sawyer.and i could tell from the blank, disinterested look in his eye that he had no idea who i was."what's this?"emerson interrupts my thoughts, grinning as he snatches the metallic flask out of my back pocket.a trail of sensation sears along the skin just above my belt as his fingers brush against my bare flesh.goosebumps spring up where his fingertips glanced against my body.it's like my every cell is hard-wired to respond to him.i need to give each and every one of those cells a stern talking-to.emerson knocks back a slug of booze without checking to see what it is first, and lets out a raucous hoot as he tastes the strong whiskey."you brought the good stuff!"he crows, draping a muscled arm across my shoulder."this must be from daddy's stash, huh?""give it back, sawyer," i demand, trying half-heartedly to push him away from me.if i'm being perfectly honest, the feel of his hard, solid body against mine is something i'll never stop secretly jonesing for-but he can never know that."come on, sis.sharing is caring," he teases, holding the flask up in the air, just out of my reach.mocking my height-or lack thereof-is one of his favorite hobbies.i sigh, refusing to engage in his game.sometimes, i miss the days where emerson didn't even know my name.we don't go to a gigantic school-there are about three hundred kids in our senior class.so for the first three years of high school, i was able to harbor a huge, unrequited crush on emerson without ever actually having to speak to him.emerson's a lacrosse player, part of the "in" crowd.because our school is so diverse, socio-economically speaking, popularity doesn't depend on how much money your family has.if it did, i might actually be known around school as something other than "that short girl who's always drawing."but the gods of popularity did not decide to favor me, it would seem.my very petite, nerdy, soft-spoken self is just about invisible in the halls of mccarren high school.in fact, these days, the thing i'm best known for there is being the daughter of the guy emerson's "hot mom" is dating.oh, goody."just take the damn flask," i mutter, turning on my heel to go, "i'm out of here anyway.enjoy yourself, sawyer."but as i attempt to make my grand exit, emerson steps directly into my path, his staggeringly built body blocking my way.i collide with his muscular form, my hands landing flush against his abdomen.i have to swallow a moan as i feel his insanely cut six pack rippling beneath my fingers.i step quickly away, catching riley's amused gaze.she knows all about my feelings for emerson, being my best friend and all.hopefully, the other dozen people here in this room can't see right through me, too.especially emerson himself."don't be such a downer," he laughs, handing me the flask and extinguishing his smoke in someone's discarded red cup."stay and have fun for once in your life.""i'm not a downer.you're just a pain in the ass," i reply, snatching the flask out of his strong hands."hey.i had a very troubled childhood," he says over-dramatically, laying a hand over his heart and arranging his features into an anguished pout."i can't help myself.""who am i, officer krupke?"i ask, laughing despite myself."give me a break."it's no wonder emerson is so popular, with his wicked sense of humor, his bad boy good looks, and his devil-may-care attitude.he could have his pick of any girl in our school, of that much i am absolutely certain.i've been keeping careful tabs on his romantic life for years now, and he definitely doesn't seem to be the "relationship type".he's hanging out with a new girl every weekend, just about.and it seems that this weekend is no exception."hey emerson," a breathy voice says from over his shoulder.two thin, manicured hands slide around his torso from behind, and a beautiful, green-eyed face peeks around his built form.my heart clenches painfully as i recognize courtney haines, a gorgeous redheaded girl in our senior class.she's our resident thespian, the beautiful star of every single school play, talent show, and choir concert.she'll probably head to new york after graduation and become some broadway sensation.but right now, she seems pretty happy in the role of girl who gets to make out with emerson sawyer tonight.i have to admit, i would be too.stop that, i chide myself, shaking off my discomfort.you're not allowed to like him like that anymore.your parents are dating.plus, he thinks of you as an annoying little gnat... when he thinks of you at all.get a grip, abby."hey riley.hey abby," courtney haines says, draping emerson's arm over her shoulder."glad you guys could make it to my little shindig!""this is your house?"i exclaim, looking around in wonder.my dad's place is pretty stately, but her home is truly a den of luxury.it's more of an estate than anything else.our area of connecticut is chock full of gigantic homes, but her family's puts them all to shame."yep.and would be my room," she smiles smugly, letting her hand travel down into emerson's back pocket."my parents were nice enough to give me the master suite and everything, their dear hearts.""how nice," riley says flatly, stepping up beside me.riley's family is distinctly working-class, and the trappings of wealth have never interested her much.she's never held my family's financial situation against me, of course.but that's only because i'm aware of the privilege that comes along with having a family that's "old money".she has no patience for the rich kids in our school who seem oblivious to how good they have it.and courtney is most certainly one of that number."come on babe," the redheaded girl says to emerson, "we're just about to play a little game.you girls should play too!""what sort of game are we talking about?"riley asks, stealing a nip of my booze."darts?poker?""seven minutes in heaven," courtney squeals, bouncing up and down excitedly on the balls of her feet."are you serious?"i blurt out."sure," courtney replies, miffed by my less-than-enthusiastic response."what's the problem?we're doing it ironically.you're some kind of hipster, aren't you?you should appreciate that.""i'm not a hipster," i reply, "i just like to read, occasionally."emerson tries to cover up a hearty chuckle with a cough.i glance over at him, amazed.did i actually just make my detractor-in-residence laugh?"whatever," courtney chirps, towing emerson back toward the group, "join in or don't.""let's get out of here," i mutter to riley, as emerson strides away."and miss your chance to wind up in the closet with your otl?"she grins back."my what?"i ask blankly."your one true love, obviously," she says, looping an arm around my waist and dragging me toward the group."oh please," i whisper, "it was just a crush!and besides, it's over now.""right," she says, rolling her eyes, "because i didn't just see you fawn over his six pack for a long, steamy moment back there.""i didn't fawn over anything," i hiss, "i just-" "ok!"courtney chirps, rubbing her hands together and looking around at her assembled guests."let's do this.everyone know the rules of seven minutes in heaven?"her eyes land on me."abby?""ha.ha."i murmur, wanting very badly to melt into a puddle."yes, i know the rules.i was in eighth grade once, too."the group chuckles, surprised by my swipe at the queen bee.courtney isn't the kind of girl who gets talked back to very often.which, in my opinion, is why she should be talked back to at every opportunity.even emerson cocks his head at me in something that looks faintly like admiration.or at least, something other than generally bored disdain, which is his default attitude toward me."ok.so who wants to pick our first two victims?"courtney asks, her green eyes sparkling with mischief."me!dibs!"riley says firmly, thrusting her hand into the air before anyone else has a chance to.a cold stab of panic rips through me as my best friend smiles wickedly."great," courtney chirps."riley, you start.who should we stick in the closet first?""don't you dare," i mutter under my breath, "riley, i mean it-" "emerson and abby!"riley crows triumphantly, shooting me a smile that clearly says, you know you want it.you'll thank me for this someday."oh," courtney replies, the corners of her pretty mouth turning down."i mean.i guess that's fine.if you're into incest or whatever."our classmates laugh with delight as that taboo word drifts through the air like some smoke from one of emerson's cigarettes.a deep pang of shame twists my core.i've spent many a sleepless night berating myself for still being attracted to emerson.i've hurled the "i word" at myself a million times, hoping to break the spell he's cast over me.but no dice.no matter how wrong the rest of the world might think it is, i'm crazy for this gorgeous, cool, sneakily intelligent boy.our parents little affair can't change that."super twisted, riley," emerson laughs, crossing his thick arms."i like it."courtney's eyes flash with jealousy as she swings her gaze my way."fine," she snaps, clearly annoyed not to be heading into the closet with emerson herself."but you two had better make good on it.no twiddling your thumbs in there.we'll want some proof that you actually did something.right everyone?"a chorus of assenting murmurs sounds off around the circle.i look around at my classmates, befuddled and humiliated."what the hell kind of proof do you want?"i ask, "i'm not the sex tape sorta gal.""figure it out yourself," courtney sniffs, shoving emerson toward me."you can thank your bestie riley for her suggestion.""thanks bestie," emerson grins at riley, coming to a stop in front of me.he makes a grand sweeping gesture, offering his arm as if we were going to a ball."ma'am?"he teases."let's just get this over with," i grumble, storming past him to the closet door.the crowd makes kissy noises as i wrench open the door and march inside with emerson on my heels.as i step into the space, i'm taken aback.i was expecting some kind of coat closet, with barely enough room to move around.but of course, courtney's closet is an enormous walk-in affair, with rows and rows of clothing, shoes, and accessories lining the huge space.her closet is fancier, and perhaps even as big, as my bedroom at home.there are golden-plated fixtures, a sparkly chandelier hanging overhead, and a decadent, velvet fainting sofa standing front-and-center.emerson steps up beside me as both of our gazes fall on the couch.we steal simultaneous glances at each other, then quickly look away.my cheeks flame red as i try and dislodge the sexy image playing out in my mind's eye : emerson laying me out across that sofa, ripping my clothes off, and having his way with me as the smooth velvet upholstery caresses my bare skin.he, on the other hand, is probably preoccupied with counting down the minutes before this little joke is over."see?this is why i never come to parties," i murmur, crossing my arms tightly across my chest."really?i thought it was'cause no one ever asked you to," he says wryly, taking a seat on the fainting sofa and stretching out his long, toned body.tormenting me, is more like it."i would have expected you to have better plans, at least," i reply."we need to start coordinating with each other so this doesn't happen.""what, this?"he asks, gesturing around at the closet as our seven minutes unfold."not this specifically," i say, rolling my eyes, "i just mean we should avoid seeing each other any more than we absolutely have to.especially now that you and your mother..." i trail off, shaking my head."since we what?"emerson snaps, suddenly on the defensive, "invaded your precious ivory tower?"i bite my lip, intimidated by his heated tone.my dad and deborah have recently decided to move in together.or rather, they've decided that deborah and emerson are going to move in with us.they're going to rent out their apartment on the other side of town and shack up in our place for the time being.one big, utterly strange, less-than-happy family.as if crushing on emerson wasn't weird enough for me, now the object of my unfortunate desire is going to be sleeping under the same roof, as well.college really can't start soon enough for me."you have to admit, it's kind of strange," i murmur, averting my eyes."dad and deborah's whole thing, i mean.they've known each other for, what, two months?and they're already moving in together?""my mom's a crazy, impulsive bitch," emerson shrugs, "and your dad seems like someone who does whatever the fuck he wants without thinking about the consequences.what about this is surprising to you?""good point," i laugh hollowly, daring to sit on the very edge of the couch beside him.the mere proximity of his body to mine has my stomach twisting in anxious knots.has it been seven minutes yet or what?"well," emerson sighs, swinging his legs around so that he's sitting beside me."are we gon na get it on now or what?""ugh," i groan, giving him a shove, "stop it, would you?why do you get so much pleasure out of making me miserable?""i don't," he replies, "it's just so goddamn easy that i can't help myself.how the hell did you get to be such a little prude?""who says i'm a prude?"i shoot back, "you don't know anything about my life.""i know that i've never seen you even talk to a guy," emerson shoots back."what're you, keeping track of my lovers or something?"i reply."get a life, sawyer."of course, i don't mind at all that emerson's taking notice of my love life, paltry though it may be.as insane as it is, i can't help but hope that there's some chance he could come to feel the same way about me as i do him.call me a dreamer, i guess.a dirty dreamer."what are brothers for?"emerson grins, slipping an arm around my waist.my head sets to spinning as the nearness of him entrances me.i look up at his gorgeous, sculpted face, mere inches away from my own.i've never been this close to him before.i memorize the contours of his perfect features-his high cheekbones, his aquiline nose, the scruff along his razor sharp jaw, and of course those dark blue eyes.from this close, i can see that there are specks of gold gleaming in his irises, and a dash of freckles across the bridge of his nose.at last, my eyes land firmly on his full, firm lips, half curled into a devilish grin.his arm is still circled around my tiny waist.am i imagining things, or is his grip growing the slightest bit tighter?a silence blooms over us, heavy and thick.my eyes flick back up to his.a cast of seriousness has come over his gaze.to my amazement, i watch as his face moves closer to mine, by barely a millimeter- "five minutes!"i hear courtney call from outside the door."shit," i mutter, tearing my eyes away from his perfect face.my whole body is on fire with scattered anticipation.for a second there, i actually thought he was going to kiss me.talk about wishful thinking."so.how are we going to please the horny masses?"i ask, nodding toward the door."i have an idea," emerson says, his grin returning at full force."you're going to give me your panties."my jaw falls open as i whip around to face him."excuse me?"i splutter."you heard me.hand them over," emerson says, punching me lightly on the arm."i can hold them up as proof that we did the deed, and everyone will know that you're not a frigid, virginal weirdo.""that is so messed up," i say, jumping to my feet.i'm just going to leave the whole "frigid virgin" thing alone for now, i decide.no use opening that can of worms."let those assholes think what they want.i'll never have to see any of them again in a few months.""come on, sis.do it for me, then," emerson says, standing to meet me.he catches my arm, giving me a soft tug toward him."don't you want to help me protect my reputation?""not really," i reply, as he closes the space between us.i wonder if he can see my heart pounding through my black sweater, see my knees trembling beneath my tartan miniskirt?"what if i ask you nicely?"he returns, his voice softer, huskier than i've ever heard it.he runs his hands down my arms, not an inch of air between our bodies.that seriousness has hardened his features once again... or is he just fucking with me?"are you really capable of that?asking nicely?"i try to joke, but my own voice seems to have dropped a lusty octave.my breath catches in my throat as his hands land firmly on my slender hips."give me your panties," he growls, his fingers tightening ever-so-slightly, "please."i stare up at him in amazement.he's totally serious.if i had any sense at all, i'd step away, laugh off his request, and wait for the next five minutes to tick by.but my sense has been fully eclipsed by my want to please him in any way that i can.maybe he's joking after all, but i'm not going to let this moment slip away between my fingers.i have to show emerson sawyer what i'm made of.it's now or never."you have to turn around," i whisper hoarsely.his eyes spark with intrigued wonder.slowly, silently, he pivots away from me.keeping my eyes fixed firmly on his face to make sure he doesn't peek, i reach up under my skirt and slip my thumbs under the elastic band of my panties.thank god i thought to wear one of my sexiest pairs tonight.i don't usually go for fancy underthings, but this black lace g-string is an exception.my breath comes hard and fast as i slowly lower my panties over my firm ass and thighs, balancing carefully as i ease them down.i step out of them, wobbling just slightly, and shiver as i feel the cool air against my sex.i can feel myself getting wet, standing so close to emerson, bare and ready.god, i hope he won't be able to tell.unless he intends to make good on it, that is... "here," i tell him, holding up the delicate lace g-string.emerson turns back to face me, looking taken off guard for the first time since i've known him."damn," he murmurs, taking the panties carefully-almost reverently-from my hand."there's more to you than i thought, abby."he called me abby, not "sis", i think to myself, a grin spreading across my face.maybe seven minutes in heaven isn't such a terrible game after all... "now, my question is," i begin, easing toward emerson once more, "what do you intend to do with those?"those soft, sculpted lips part, ever-so-slightly, as he draws in a deep breath."well," he starts, letting his blue eyes travel down the length of my body."i can tell you what i'd like to-" a shrill scream rings out from somewhere within the massive house, a wave of frantic noise building from below.the din rises, tearing my and emerson's attention away from each other.the pounding music cuts off abruptly, and through the cacophony ringing out beneath our feet, a new set of voices can be heard loud and clear."police!everybody out!""break it up, break it up!""anyone still here in five minutes is under arrest!""fuck me," i mutter angrily, shoving a hand through my blonde hair."certainly no time for that now," emerson laughs roughly, playing off our intense moment.or maybe i was just imagining that intensity?i'll never know now.i squint as bright light floods the closet once more.someone's ripped open the door, revealing the chaos unfolding in the master bedroom suite.courtney is bawling frantically as everyone else makes a beeline for the exits.emerson shoves my panties into his pocket just in time, before riley darts into the closet to fetch us."we have to go!"she says firmly."how are we going to make it past the cops?"i ask worriedly.running from the police isn't exactly my strong suit.luckily, emerson is a bit more experienced on this front than i."come on," he commands, a daredevil smile spreading across his face as he takes my wrist in his hand.riley gives me a big wink as emerson carts me away into the frenzy of escaping partygoers.we dive into the fray, the voices of police officers and drunken high schoolers commingling in a deafening clash.as we run along the second story landing, i watch as one incautious classmate takes a swing at a cop, then finds himself in handcuffs a moment later.i stay as close to emerson as i can as he barrels through the crowd, protecting me from the surge of moving bodies.we careen into an empty bedroom and slam the door behind us, our chests heaving with exertion."where did riley go?"i ask, panicked."no time to look for her," emerson says gruffly, striding toward the bedroom window, "if i get arrested again, my mom's gon na ship me off to the army or something."he wrenches open the window and kicks the screen clear out of the frame."is that really necessary?"i hiss, as he peers out into the night."jackpot," he says, ignoring my question, "we can climb right down this trellis.and your dad's place-sorry, our place-is close enough to make a run for it.""how am i supposed to keep up with you, mr.varsity athlete?"i demand, planting my hands on my hips."run fast," he winks, swinging a leg over the window sill.i let out a frightening yelp as he disappears out the window, and rush forward to make sure he hasn't fallen.i look on as emerson dismounts gracefully onto the lush green grass below, looking up at me expectantly."i can't do that," i call down to him."you have to," he insists, "don't be such a little chicken shit, sis.""no.i mean, i can't..." i trail off, blushing wildly, "you still have my.you know."a wild, raucous laugh rips out of emerson's throat as he remembers that my panties are still in his pocket.i'm totally commando.and wearing a skirt.not exactly the best trellis-climbing attire."i promise i won't peek," emerson says, getting a hold of himself."just come on.""no fucking way!"i reply, crossing my arms."look.it's either scamper down here, bare-assed, or get arrested.your call," emerson shoots back."i'm pretty sure your precious colleges won't be thrilled with your having a criminal record."i bite my lip, glancing over my shoulder as the din of the raid reaches its peak.he's right.i'm all out of options."you have to close your eyes," i tell him."i mean it, sawyer.""yeah, yeah," he says, screwing his eyes shut."get a move on, weirdo."a cool breeze brushes against my most intimate flesh as i scoot onto the window sill.as far as strange sensations go, this has to be up near the top.checking once more to make sure emerson's eyes are really closed, i grab onto the vine-covered trellis beside the window.with a deep breath, i swing out into the open air.i've never been very good with heights, so this is not exactly my idea of a good time."oh, for fuck's sake," i groan, as the breeze lifts up my skirt."what's that?"emerson asks, one eye almost cracking open."no!"i screech, my stomach dropping at the thought of him getting an eyeful of my cooch from down below.in a desperate, unthinking moment, i try and smooth down my skirt, losing my grip on the flimsy trellis.i feel my body pitching backward, plummeting through the air.i brace myself for the impact, waiting to hear my bones crackling as i hit the ground.but in the next moment, i feel two thick arms wrap firmly around my small body.i blink up at emerson from where i lay cradled in his grasp.he didn't even stagger when i fell into his embrace, he's that much bigger than i am.for a moment, it's all we can do to stare at each other in wonder.we're closer than we've ever been before.so, so close...i glance down at my legs and see that one of emerson's hands is gripping my bare ass, full on-the tips of his fingers dangerously close to my exposed sex."oh," i say faintly."oh..." he replies, realizing what it is that he's got a handful of.he lowers me unceremoniously to my feet, brushing himself off brusquely.am i crazy, or is that a slight blush creeping into his cheeks?"let's get out of here," he says gruffly, shoving my panties back into my hands and taking off at a jog.i stare at his retreating back for a long moment before coming to.with trembling hands, i step back into my lacy underwear and set off in his wake.no way is he going to wait around for me-i should know that much by now.chapter two we spend the next hour darting through the thick, shadowy woods that blanket the town, slowly making our way home.barely a word is spoken by either of us as we make our way along, pausing whenever we hear a siren in the distance.by the time we stumble through the brush and land in our backyard, i'm covered in scrapes and dirt.emerson, for his part, seems to be mostly unscathed.but of course he is.the lights are all out as we tiptoe into my childhood home-a stately but relatively modest tudor house.dad and deborah must be asleep by now.it is, after all, past two in the morning.hopefully dad won't ask too many questions about what i'm doing home in the morning-i told him i'd be sleeping over at riley's.but he's not exactly the type to check up, and i doubt that deborah even goes through the motions of keeping tabs on emerson anymore.with a little bit of luck, we'll be in the clear.emerson and i slip through the back doors and plod up the carpeted staircase, skipping the creaky stair, coming at last to the second story landing.there are three bedrooms in my dad's house : the master bedroom just off the landing, which he and deborah are sharing now, and two smaller rooms at either side of the hall.my room is down to the right, emerson's is to the left.he doesn't even bother saying goodnight before turning away and slipping into his room.with a sigh, i trudge back to my own quarters at the opposite end of the hall.closing the door gently behind me, i belly flop onto my bed, burying my face in the fluffy pillow and fighting the urge to scream.i can't sort through everything that happened between emerson and i tonight.between the tense moments during seven minutes of heaven to his accidental but steamy caress after i took a tumble off the trellis, i'm totally at a loss.tonight was the first time we've seen each other outside of school and home since he and deborah moved in.and it's certainly the first time anything so... charged has passed between us.i flip over onto my back, staring up at the ceiling.the glow-in-the-dark stars i put up as a kid still hang overhead, despite my near-adult status.with a pang of heartache, i realize that emerson and i are bound to part ways once we turn eighteen and graduate high school.i'll never know what could have been between us, if our parents hadn't ruined everything by getting together.then again, he probably never would have even learned my name if not for them.so i guess i should be somewhat grateful.emphasis on somewhat.knowing that i'll never fall asleep with all this tension built up inside of me, i roll over and slide open the top drawer of my night table.there, hidden among a jumble of makeup and jewelry, is a tiny device disguised to look like a tube of lipstick.its actual purpose is a whole lot more in line with what i need right now.i press a hidden button on the little bullet and smile as it whirs to life.my reliable vibrator-the best battery-operated boyfriend around.laying back, i bring the vibrator down between my legs, slipping it beneath the lace panties that emerson held in his hands not hours ago.the mere thought of his broad, capable hands is enough to get me off almost at once.swallowing a low moan, i come into that black lace g-string, with emerson's face suspended in my mind's eye all the while."hopefully that won't make breakfast too awkward," i whisper to myself, savoring the relaxing wave that washes over me as i drift into a deep, satisfied sleep.the silence that first fell between emerson and i after he saved me from breaking my neck persists for the better part of the next two weeks.my handsome housemate may as well be a ghost, for all i see of him.he leaves for school early in the morning, stays out late at night, and generally avoids me like the plague.did i totally wig him out that night at the party?i could have sworn that he was sending me some flirtatious signals, but maybe i totally misread him.maybe he just thinks i'm an incest-loving freak show now.i've never been the best flirt, i guess.riley almost dies when i give her all the juicy details a few days after the party.turns out she let us get separated when the cops showed up, so that emerson and i could have an "adventure" all on our own."so, he basically took off your panties and finger-banged you," she sums it up as we head off on a coffee run during our school lunch hour."that is a very liberal translation," i say, blushing like crazy as i stare out the passenger side window."he is so into you," riley grins."i can't believe it, after all this time."she catches my frown and backtracks."i mean, i can totally believe why he'd be into you, it's just-" "i know that's he a bit above my pay grade, ri," i tell her, leaning back against my seat."i'm not exactly up to par with the girls he usually hangs out with."without preamble, riley swerves violently onto the shoulder of the main road, causing me to yelp in abject terror."listen to me," she says firmly, taking my face in her hands."you are every bit as sexy and bitchin' as emerson sawyer.he'd be lucky to have you, abby.""you don't have to do that," i insist."he's the badass, gorgeous lacrosse star, i'm the weird, short, artsy girl.if this were a teen movie, maybe we'd stand a chance.but i know my place on the food chain.guys like emerson don't go for girls like me.""oh please," riley moans, rolling her eyes, "in a few months' time, we're all gon na be out in the real world.you could take your high-waisted shorts and dark lipstick-wearing self to any major city and be an'it girl' in three second flat.the rest of these assholes will have already peaked in high school, so count your blessings that you're a weirdo now.""thanks?i think?"i laugh, "really, ri.you always know how to cheer me up.""damn straight i do," she says, tossing her black curls over her shoulder."that's what best friends are for-assuring you that boning your maybe-someday-stepbrother is totally chill as long as your dad doesn't put a ring on it first."i shake my head as riley laughs, pulling back onto the road with the radio blasting.i try my best to keep riley's words of encouragement close to my heart as the silence between me and emerson continues on.you'd think we were locked in a nuclear arms race, for how cold things have become between us.i catch glimpses of him at school, and have the unfortunate experience of watching courtney try to stick her tongue down his throat on more than one occasion.but as the days until my eighteenth birthday tick away, the silent treatment goes on.a few days before my grand entrance into adulthood, i arrive home from school irritated and disgruntled.the stress of college applications and ap course work coupled with the ongoing radio silence between me and emerson has me way on edge.so the very last thing i want to see when i walk in front door of my home is dad and deborah, making out like a couple of teenagers against the kitchen island."jesus," i mutter, starting for my room, "is everybody getting some action around here besides me?""oh!abby!"deborah giggles from the kitchen, "good.you're home.""hi dad.hi deb," i mutter gloomily, standing at the foot of the stairs."i'm just gon na head up to my room and get some studying in-" "nooo, come on.come chat with us first!"deb insists, bustling out into the foyer to apprehend me.though emerson and i are the same age, deborah is about ten years my dad's junior.truth be told, she looks even younger than her biological age.her voluminous platinum blonde hair is always arranged in luscious curls, her makeup applied perfectly.this stands to reason, given that she works as a freelance makeup artist, mostly doing weddings and the like.she's way taller than i am, especially given her penchant for wearing three-inch heels.and, i have to admit, the lady's got a killer rack.between the tits and her habit of wearing loud neon colors, it's no wonder that my dad took notice of her.my question is, what does she see in him?i wouldn't say that my father is unattractive.he's just very... unremarkable.he was quite the looker as a younger man, but my mom sandy was the real beauty.their wedding pictures look like something out of a movie.i inherited my mom's facial features, but missed out on her vibrant red hair and hourglass curves.can't pick and choose what you inherit from your parents, i guess.and you certainly don't get to choose who your parents are in the first place."it's been ages since we've had a good talk," deb gushes, plunking me down at the kitchen table."tell me everything.how's school?any boyfriends?spill, girl!"i glance over at my father, silently begging him not to make me engage in small talk with his girlfriend.but he just grins at the two of us like we're some big, happy family.as grating as deb can be, i haven't seen my dad smile like this in years.it's the least i can do to muscle through some mindless chatter."well," i begin, "i dunno..." the sound of the front door opening is my saving grace.i look over my shoulder and see emerson stride across the threshold, making a beeline for his room.but deborah has other plans, and rushes out to greet him with a squeal."not so fast!"she cries, seizing her son by the arm."it's not every day that i can manage to snag you and abby for a chat.come on!we're having family time!""are you high or something?"emerson grumbles.i can tell by his inflection that it's an honest question.i wonder what it must have been like for him, growing up with a single mom who had substance abuse issues.my dad's drinking didn't get bad until mom passed away, and by then i was already fourteen.but from what i understand, deb's drinking has been going on for most of emerson's life.my heart twists painfully just thinking about what a rough go he must have had.no wonder he's got more defense strategies than the pentagon."this is so wonderful," deb goes on, forcing emerson into a chair across the table from me.we immediately avert our eyes, looking anywhere but at each other.the uncomfortable silence between us is deafening in this enclosed space.what i wouldn't give for a trap door or an ejection seat right now."while we've got you both here," my dad finally cuts in, wrapping an arm around deb's waist."we should talk about your birthdays this weekend.""birthdays?"emerson asks, his brow furrowing."as in plural?"i add, looking up at my dad."sure!haven't you guys figured it out yet?"dad laughs, "your birthdays are only one day apart!abby's is may 4th, and emerson's is may 3rd."a satisfied grin spreads across emerson's face as he leans back in his chair.for the first time since that night at the party, he swings his gaze directly my way."look at that," he says, keeping those blue eyes locked on mine."i am your big brother after all.""oh, that's so precious!"deb swoons."i'm so glad you two are feeling more like family.that makes me so, so happy.what should we do to celebrate your eighteenth birthdays?bowling?the movies?""i was gon na buy a shit load of porn, cigarettes, and scratch off lottery tickets and have myself a private party," emerson says bluntly."you all are more than welcome to join in.though things might get a little... awkward."i tear my eyes away from his at this last bit, feeling my cheeks burning hotly.he's baiting me.i can tell."honestly, emerson," deb says, her cheerful veneer cracking, "do you have to shit all over every nice thing i try to do for you?""don't worry, deb.he was just kidding," my dad coos, planting a kiss on his girlfriend's forehead."weren't you, emerson?""whatever helps you sleep at night, sport," emerson replies shortly, slapping his palms against the table."now, as fun as this has been, i've got things to do."he strolls out of the kitchen, pausing for half a second to snatch a bag of chips out of the cupboard.deb is so pissed off at his behavior that she and my dad don't even try to stop me as i hurry off after emerson."hey," i call to him, taking the stairs two at a time to catch up."emerson, wait.""what.did i steal your afternoon snack?"he grins over his shoulder, holding the chips up over my head.his favorite game."if you can grab'em you can have'em!""yeah, no.i'm not interested in your chips," i say, standing before him on the landing."i just wanted to know if we're on speaking terms again now or what.""what do you mean, sis?"he asks, ripping open the bag and popping a chip into his mouth.this boy can even making chewing sexy.goddamn him."i mean... are you done giving me the cold shoulder?"i press him."you've been avoiding me since that party the other night.when we-" "whoa, whoa," emerson chuckles."you are way paranoid.i haven't been avoiding you.i just haven't noticed you.there's been other shit going on.and you're pretty easy to miss.""bullshit," i snap, taking a step toward him."i know you've been going out of your way not to see me ever since that stupid game in the closet.something... Happened between us, and-" "i don't know what you're talking about," he says, the joking laughter fading from his voice."but i do know that i don't want to hear another word about it out of you.ok?""you can't just pretend that nothing happened!"i cry out, exasperated."keep your voice down," he growls, glancing down at the kitchen where our parents are still talking in hushed tones."i won't.not unless we can have a real conversation about this," i say at full volume, crossing my arms."you owe me that, at least.""you are so fucking impossible," he says, shoving a hand through his chestnut hair."ok. fine.you wan na take a drive or something?will that shut you up?"despite the context of his offer, my stomach still does a thrilled somersault at the idea of being alone with him."sure," i say, "let's hit the road.bro.""i hope you know i'm just using you as an excuse to get out of this house again," he grumbles, dropping the chips onto the floor and storming off down the stairs.i follow right behind him, wondering whether or not he's fucking with me.at this moment, it doesn't much matter.i'm just happy that he's speaking to me again at all.you're just pathetic, i berate myself silently.berating myself is something i'm pretty great at-i have a lot practice."are you leaving again already?"deb cries from the kitchen as we try to make our exit."you just got home!""yes mother," emerson sighs, in his most over-the-top cordial voice."abigail and i are going to take a spin around town.take in some fresh air.cheerio!""oh.well.good.you guys are spending some time together," deb says uncertainly."um.be back... sometime?""will do!"emerson says, tipping an imaginary hat to our parents.i step out the door after him, shaking my head in amused befuddlement."and i'm the weirdo, right?"i laugh."haven't you figured it out yet, sis?"he says, striding over to the beat up chevy parked in the driveway."we're both weirdoes, you and me.get in the car."i trundle into the front seat, trying not to gawk as i settle in.i've never been allowed in emerson's car before.true, he and his mother have only been living with us for a few weeks.but still.being admitted into this "sacred vessel" of his feels pretty significant.it's all i can do to keep myself from caressing the worn out leather seats, the dusty dashboard, as if this car were a shrine to the boy i'm crazy for."so.what kind of shit do big brothers do with their little sisters?"he asks, rolling down his window and lighting up a smoke."want me to take you to the playground or something?""no.but you could bum me a cigarette, to begin with," i say lightly."you don't smoke," emerson scoffs, looking over at me sharply."not anymore.but i did," i inform him."no fucking way," he says, narrowing his eyes."yes fucking way, i assure you," i reply."come on.gim me one.""if you don't mind my saying," he goes on, passing me his pack of camels and a lighter, "smoking doesn't really seem like your kind of thing.""there are lots of things you don't know about me, emerson," i reply, plucking out a cigarette and lighting it up."but if you're real nice to me, i might just tell you a couple."he stares at me for a long, silent moment.the same look he trained on me the night of the party-in the closet when i handed him my panties, when he caught me in his arms after i fell-is there in his eyes again now.i do my best to draw deep breaths, hoping he can't read my thoughts.my desires.but instead of giving me any sort of clue as to what he's thinking, he just starts the car and drives off toward town.we zoom along in silence, unsure of what to say.or at least, i'm unsure.maybe he just doesn't care to spare any words on me.after a while, he flips on the car radio.a song by the foo fighters comes on, and i sit up a little in my seat.they're one of my favorite bands-just heavy enough for my taste.i start singing along, nodding my head with the beat.emerson lets out a short, surprised laugh."would have taken you for more of a taylor swift kind of girl," he says over the music."but i'm not supposed to make assumptions about you anymore, right?""that's right," i smile."can i at least assume that you'll want dinner at some point tonight?"he asks.i have to fight hard from letting a dopey, love-struck look escape across my features.he just wants to grab food.it's not a date.i just happen to be along for the ride.but still."yeah, i'm starving," i tell him."great.me too.let's swing by the crystal dawn," he says, turning off onto a main road in town.chapter three the crystal dawn is our local diner, frequented by just about everyone in our relatively small town.high school kids, senior citizens, working class parents-no one can resist the crystal's dawn's greasy spoon appeal.emerson rolls up to the silver diner and swings into a parking space, cutting off another car with a laugh."do you just go out of your way to antagonize people?"i ask, stepping onto the sidewalk."i don't mean to antagonize them.most people just happen to be assholes.i just treat them the way they deserve."he shrugs, tossing his smoke into the gutter.i follow suit, relishing my final drag.it's been over a year since i've had a cigarette.damn, do i miss them sometimes."what a charming attitude," i say, rolling my eyes."thanks sis," emerson winks, holding the door open for me like a real gentleman.or so i think, until he lets it fall in my face at the last possible second.yeah.maybe all this lovey-dovey nonsense is just in my head after all.we walk across the crowded dining car, over to a red vinyl booth in the back corner.one of the regular waitresses, a woman in her forties with heavy blue eye shadow and a perm, plunks a couple of menus down onto the table.we don't even have to look at them, of course.we've both lived in this town long enough to know exactly what we want.it's said that you can tell a lot about a person by their usual crystal dawn order."what're you having?"i ask emerson with a playfully grave tone.he wiggles his eyebrows conspiratorially, perfectly aware of the weight of the question."bacon burger.medium rare.chipotle mayo.""of course you're a raging carnivore," i groan, shaking my head."well, what are you getting?"he shoots back."broccoli and cheese soup in a bread bowl," i smile."wait," he replies, laying his hands on the table."you're not... a vegetarian, are you?""i sure am," i reply with a chipper smile."of fucking course," he grumbles, looking downright appalled."you know factory farming is destroying our planet, right?"i tease him, putting on my best goodie-two-shoes voice."you know that tofu is a sin against humanity, right?"he shoots back.that one takes me by surprise, drawing a real laugh out of me for once."to be perfectly honest, i didn't start being a vegetarian for the environment's sake," i tell him."i wish i was that noble.but the real reason is way stupider.""well.why did you start?"he asks, halfway interested.that's still halfway more than usual, at least."when i was eight, my dad let me watch jurassic park with him," i reply."you know that scene where the goat gets eaten by the t-rex, and its leg flies up and sticks to the window?""yeah, obviously," emerson replies."shit was groady.""yep.that's what did it," i admit."i haven't eaten meat since watching that movie.my mom was so pissed at my dad for turning me off chicken nuggets, i don't think she spoke to him for days.they kept waiting for me to grow out of it, but i never did.and so, here we are.""that's hilarious," emerson says, smiling genuinely for perhaps the first time i've known him.it's not like his usual, sarcastic grin.it's something warmer, more honest.and it just about does me in.luckily, the waitress comes back for our orders right at that moment, so i don't end up throwing myself at him right then and there.we lapse into silence again as we wait for our food to arrive.he agreed to talk to me about what's been going on between us, since the night of the party.but now that the moment has arrived, i can't think of how to begin."so.are you and courtney a thing or what?"i blurt out.smooth, abby, i grumble internally."courtney?nah," emerson shrugs, "a little too high maintenance for me.and crazy as shit, too.plus she's always got show tunes on... who listens to show tunes for fun?""i'm sure she's... nice.when you get to know her," i reply.the last thing i want to do is go shitting on other girls just because they happen to have sucked face with emerson.if i did that, just about every pretty girl in our school would be on my shit list.girl on girl hate is something i try and avoid altogether, if i can help it."i'm not really that interested in'nice', is the thing," emerson scoffs, picking at a bit of loose paint on the table."what... are you interested in?"i ask, my voice going soft on me.emerson lifts his eyes to mine, the gold specks reflecting in the dying spring light outside the diner window.i swallow hard, waiting for him to go on."i'm interested in someone who can teach me things.show me things," he says.i'm totally taken aback by his direct answer."oh?"i say meekly."i could hang out with hot girls who don't give a damn about me as a person, or look for someone who seems interested in something other than my fantastic body," he continues, "i'm gon na go with the latter."of course, he can't let a serious phrase go by without turning into a joke.is that a defense mechanism or what?"have you ever met someone like that?"i dare to ask him, "someone you could be interested in for more than a weekend?"he lets me writhe under his gaze, taking his sweet time to formulate an answer to my question.i can feel my cheeks growing hotter by the second before he finally says one word : "maybe."the rest of the restaurant seems to fall away around us as emerson trains his eyes on me.i have to choose my response very, very carefully here.this one little moment could be a turning point.a transformation.with my heart in my throat, i let my hand rest on the table, only a couple of inches away from his.those mere inches of space spark with electricity, searing my already frayed nerves.i wish i could tell him that i want the same thing from a relationship-to be with someone who challenges me, like he does.someone who's not interested in being nice or normal, like he is.someone who could show me a life i'd never be able to dream up on my own.like he very well could."emerson," i say softly, letting my hand drift slowly toward his, "i-" the front door of the diner flies open, slamming against the wall with a loud clatter.emerson turns to look over his shoulder at the sound, and just like that, the spell is broken.shit.i glance up, annoyed, to see who's disrupted our near-perfect moment.but when i recognize the group that's just sauntered inside, i feel myself going numb."goddamn it," i whisper, "not now."i quickly hiding my hands under the table, not wanting emerson to see how they've begun to shake.i pretend to be very interested in something out the window as i hear the boisterous voices of three guys from my school fill the enclosed space, one of whom i'm very intimately, and very unfortunately, acquainted with.to my horror, i watch from the corner of my eye as emerson waves at the trio.of course.they're his lacrosse teammates.he has no idea why flagging them down is the worst thing he could possibly do to me right now.against my silent prayers to any god that's listening, the three boys stroll over to our table.emerson swings his body around to greet them."hey guys," he says to his three teammates."hey tank," says one of the guys, a blonde junior named steve, using emerson's lacrosse nickname."what's up?""nothing.as usual," emerson laughs, "what's happening tonight?""some people will be over at my place," says roger, a lanky senior."got a couple of dime bags, if you want in.""you know i do," emerson replies."we interrupting you?"steve asks.i feel their three sets of eyes fall on my face like laser beams.shit.i was hoping i'd get out of this without having to say a word to them."just grabbing some food," emerson says, "right abby?"with great reluctance, i raise my eyes to the four boys before me.i try to keep my gaze trained on emerson, or even steve and roger, but my eyes can't help themselves.they flick masochistically up to the third boy standing next to our table.he's as tall as emerson, with jet black hair slicked away from his hard jaw, his full lips.his own dark eyes skirt away from mine the second we make eye contact.he hasn't looked at me in years.i like to believe it's because he can't bear to, that the guilt and shame are too much for him to deal with.but in reality, it's probably just cold indifference that repels his gaze from me.his name is tucker jacoby.he very nearly derailed my entire life, back when we were fifteen.and it's abundantly clear that emerson has no idea."yeah..." i finally manage to say, my voice barely audible."just getting some food.""you guys know abby, right?"emerson says to the trio.i can feel my skin starting to crawl with every passing moment they... He lingers beside me."sure.yeah," steve nods, "you do all those cartoons in the school newspaper, right?""right," i say shortly, my hands shaking violently under the table."that's me.""i liked the one with the duck," roger puts in, "didn't really get the joke, but-" "i'm starving," tucker cuts in.the sound of his voice is like an ice pick to my composure."let's get a table.see you, tank."he turns away without acknowledging me, just as he's done for the past couple of years.emerson raises an eyebrow at his retreating back before glancing over at me.he freezes as he catches a glimpse of my upset expression, taken off guard by the extremity of my discomfort."see ya, tank," roger says, turning toward the table that tucker's claimed for them."think you'll swing by my place tonight?""yeah.i'll get back to you on that," emerson says, his eyes still fixed on my troubled face.the sudden concern clouding his handsome face is enough to make my own eyes prickle with hot tears.roger and steve trundle away after tucker, leaving emerson and i alone again at last.our food has yet to arrive, but i've lost any trace of my appetite.the air in the crystal dawn feels poisonous now.contaminated.i'm finding it harder to breathe with every shallow gulp of air i can manage to force down."abby, are you ok?"emerson asks, reaching for me across the table."i. i need..." i gasp, struggling to form the simplest words."can we go?please?""of course we can," emerson says, his voice soft but firm.he rises to his feet and offers me a hand as i stand, shakily.i feel the comforting weight of his arm as he drapes it over my shoulders, holding me snugly against his muscled side.usually, i'd be all butterflies and giddiness to be this close to him.but in the midst of my anxiety attack, all i can feel is icy panic.i can't help but glance over at tucker as emerson leads me out of the diner.i should be used to the uncaring expression he saves just for me by now.i shouldn't let the mere sight of him unravel me like this.but i'm just not strong enough to not give a shit.i never have been.after what feels like a decade, i settle into the passenger seat of emerson's chevy.as he rounds the car, sinks into the driver's seat, and slams the door shut behind him, the bubble of my fear and apprehension bursts.shame and relief crash simultaneously over me, rendering me speechless as emerson turns to take me in.his look, infused with compassion, undoes me completely.fat tears roll down my cheeks as i stare straight ahead, wishing that i could actually be as small as tucker makes me feel.if i was, it would be easy enough to slip through the cracks and disappear forever."abby," emerson says quietly, "can you tell me what's going on?"i draw in a deep, ragged breath, trying to muster the strength for words."i'm sorry," i finally manage to whisper."i'm so sorry.""you don't need to apologize for anything," he says, his brow furrowing."abby, is it ok if i hold your hand?"his simple request acts as a life preserver, saving me from going under in this rush of emotion.i look over at him and nod silently.without pause, emerson reaches for the hand that is currently gripping my thigh, uncurls my fingers, and laces them with his own.i cling onto him like a drowning woman, amazed that he took the time to ask me if i wanted to be touched.i remember, through my thick fog of misery, that he must have plenty of practice being the comforter.how many times has he sat with deb as she descended into a depressive stupor?"thank you," i manage to tell him through my tears."any time," he replies, giving my hand a squeeze."are you with me now?""i am.i'm here," i gasp.his simple touch was enough to drag me through the thick of my panic.i can feel the world coming back into focus around me."if you want to talk about what just happened back there," emerson says, rubbing his thumb against my still-trembling hand, "we can."i look over at him, leaning toward me from the passenger seat.i've never seen him like this before.he's calm.gentle.caring.and all for me.i desperately want to explain myself, to tell him why i had to get out of that diner the second tucker walked in.but letting him in on my shameful secret... what if it wiped that compassionate look right off his face?what if he was never able to look at me the same way again?we're so close to figuring out how to talk to each other, how to spend time together despite everything.i don't want to ruin that.not for anything."would you mind if we just... Went home?"i ask, forcing my voice to remain steady."sure," emerson says, "yeah.we can go home, abby."he holds my gaze for a long moment before turning back to the wheel.delicately, he extricates his fingers from mine to start the car.but the second we're in motion, i reach for it again.his hand is my anchor in this moment.i need it.i need him.we ride home in utter silence.the radio stays off, the windows stay closed.i gaze out the window at the darkening landscape, the familiar contours of the town i've called home all my life.the incident at the diner only makes me want to speed up the days until i finally get to leave this place behind, go somewhere where nobody knows me at all.but how can i wish these days away knowing that my flight from here will mean being separated from emerson?anger floods in to replace my fear and shame.tucker has already taken so much from me.caused me so much pain.now my long-awaited conversation with emerson about where we stand has been ruined, thanks to him.if he proves to be the thing that keeps emerson and i from every truly getting a chance at being close, i'll never forgive him.then again, i never plan on forgiving him anyway.there are some things that no amount of time or patience can mend.i know that from experience.chapter four despite emerson's offer to listen if i want to talk about the "diner incident", we don't get into it upon arriving home.dad and deborah have gone out for dinner, as they do most nights when emerson and i aren't around.the house feels cavernous and cold tonight.this place hasn't felt like home since mom passed away, but after what just happened with tucker, the entire town feels uninhabitable to me.i feel like i'm fifteen years old again.scared, confused, and so, so lonely.only now, there's actually someone here to help me through it."we still need to rustle up some grub," emerson says, moving ahead of me into the kitchen.he doesn't seem to mind my radio silence about what just went down at the restaurant, but there's definitely been a shift in his demeanor.his usual grin has been replaced by a comforting smile, and his entire attitude toward me seems gentler.nicer.it isn't that he's pitying me, thank god.it's almost as if he's recognized something of himself in me.go figure-i'm sure he has more pain hidden inside of him than anyone should be made to live with."well, i'm a terrible cook," i tell him, leaning my elbows on the kitchen island."couldn't even boil water if i tried.""huh.lucky for you, i happen to be an excellent chef," emerson says seriously, opening up the kitchen cupboard."wait.really?"i ask, surprised."really," he replies, "i had to cook for mom most of the time growing up.letting a wasted person near sharp knives and open flames is a terrible idea.""that follows," i reply."so, what do you have in mind, master chef?""well," he says, plucking a few items down off the cupboard shelf."how do you feel about risotto?""are you kidding?"i blurt.that's one of my all-time favorite foods.i used to ask my mom to make it every year for my birthday.but there's no way he could have known that."i'll take that as a'fuck yeah'," emerson smiles, plunking a container of arborio rice down onto the counter."why don't you find us a movie on demand to watch or something?i'll get this thing whipped up in no time."i follow his suggestion and head for the living room.stealing a glance at emerson over my shoulder, i feel my heart warm up a few degrees.his face is composed, free from the scowl that usually rests there.with dad and deb out for the night, i can almost imagine that this is our place-mine and emerson's alone.we've never once spent time like this together.he hardly ever stays in for a night, and i'm mostly preoccupied with extracurriculars and long study sessions at the library.after our disastrous outing before, this evening is suddenly looking up.maybe we'll even get around to discussing this sudden shift in our relationship.he's cooking me dinner, after all.clearly, miracles do happen.i scroll through dozens upon dozens of movies as emerson cooks.the savory fragrance of his recipe makes my stomach growl in eager anticipation."jesus.was that you?"he calls from the kitchen."not very ladylike, sis.""what do you want from me?"i grin back."your gourmet masterpiece is taking forever.i'm starving in here.""i could always just scrap it and make you some easy mac instead," he teases."you're not that inhumane," i shoot back."that is true," he chuckles, filling two bowls with the steamy, decadent meal he's prepared."besides, this looks too good to waste."emerson walks over to the deep sectional couch where i've made myself a nest of pillows and blankets.i let out a low moan as i smell the garlicky, mushroomy goodness of the food.emerson hands me a heaping bowl topped with a mound of parmesan cheese and plops down onto the couch beside me, kicking his feet up onto the coffee table.almost reverently, i scoop a bite of risotto onto my gigantic silver spoon and raise it to my mouth.emerson watches expectantly out of the corner of his eye as i sample his cooking."oh my god," i mumble around a mouthful of rice, "i think i just came."emerson lets out a bark of surprised laughter at my crass joke."so you like it then?"i nod eagerly, burrowing into the couch while i take bite after delicious bite of the food he's prepared.it occurs to me, as i nosh, that i haven't had an honest-to-god home cooked meal since my mom died.that awareness only makes this gesture of emerson's that much more meaningful to me."so, what're we watching?"he asks, taking a bite of risotto for himself.i grab the remote and click through to the film of my choice.it's an old favorite of mine."ta-da!"i say happily."the fuck?"emerson scoffs as he sees what movie i've picked out for us tonight."i thought you were gon na go for something with super heroes.or vampires.anything but this.""what?"i reply."dr. zhivago is a classic!""classically depressing," he says."have you ever even seen it?"i press."well.no," he admits, "but look at all that snow and shit on the poster!unless we're talking about snow dogs, that's never a sign of a cheerful movie.""cheerful is overrated," i tell him, "and this movie is fantastic.just give it a chance.i promise, you'll love it."he raises an eyebrow at my fervid vow."well..." i amend, "i promise you won't absolutely despise it, anyway."if it were any other day, i'm sure emerson would never submit to watching an old, tragically romantic movie with me.i can practically see him swallowing his pride like a big old bite of mushroom risotto as he says, "fine.put it on.i'll try not to fall asleep."with a gleeful squeak, i queue up the film and settle back against the couch.as the opening theme swells to fill our living room, emerson eases over on the couch so that our bodies are almost, almost touching.his closeness, his kindness, and his understanding very nearly erase the upsetting events of this afternoon.i let myself get swept up in the film, in his company, in the wonderful, unprecedented feeling of comfort that's wrapped around me like so many blankets.as we fill our bellies and turn our attention toward the movie, i'm amazed at how normal this all feels.spending time with emerson feels natural.easy.maybe there was a little silver lining to being so vulnerable in front of him earlier today, scary as it was.of their own accord, our bodies drift closer together over the course of the long film.the big meal has made me happy and sleepy, and i can feel my eyelids growing heavy.emerson's long, built body relaxes next to mine.and as we both lose ourselves in epic story, he casually encircles me with a strong, muscular arm.i'm elated to be close to him, but more surprised at how effortlessly our bodies fit together.i snuggle against his side, resting my head on his shoulder.the warmth of his body is like a balm to my frayed nerves, and we stay cozied up for the duration of the film.at long last, when the final credits roll, i'm reluctant to reach for the remote, to let reality come sweeping into this perfect, suspended moment.i think i can sense hesitation in him too, but that could just be a lot of wishful thinking.at long last, the screen goes black.the house is almost entirely dark without the blue glow of the tv.but even so, neither of us makes the first move to disentangle our bodies.if there was any question before, i know that this embrace is more than merely platonic.emerson's hand moves slowly along my side, sending sensation sparking along each nerve he brushes.i turn my face gently toward his, peering up in the dim light.his blue eyes gleam even in the darkness, and his caring expression gives me the courage to rest a hand on the firm panes of his chest.i take a deep, steadying breath, willing myself to be strong.steady."thank you for this," i say, unsurprised to find that my voice has slipped low in my register with wanting him."i know you were out to make me feel better after this afternoon, and... well.it worked.this was exactly what i needed.""i'm glad," he says, tugging me just a hair tighter against him."i hated seeing you so upset back at the restaurant.i figured dinner and a movie was the least i could do.was that a panic attack, or-?""anxiety attack, yeah," i reply, scooting up so that our faces are level."i've been having them for a few years now.""did they start when your mom passed away?"he asks."um.no," i say, averting my eyes, "not exactly.""you don't have to tell me anything you don't want to," emerson insists."no.i do want to.i want you to know what today was about, i just..." i sigh, trying to find the right words."hardly anyone knows.and this whole us-getting-along thing is pretty new, you know?i just need to know... that i can trust you."i swallow a gasp as emerson lays a hand on my cheek, his eyes burning intently into mine."you can trust me," he says, "i promise you that much, abby.how can i prove it to you?""trade me a secret for a secret?"i laugh, only half joking."ok," he replies, his gaze unwavering, "deal.""wait, seriously?"i ask, sitting up a little straighter."seriously," he says, letting his fingertips trail over my shoulder, down my arm."i want you to know i'm for real.i'll tell you a secret if you'll let me in on one of yours."i try my best to take deep breaths, suddenly afraid of knowing emerson's secrets, being bound to share mine as well.but i know i have to be bold, now.i've spent too much time living in shame and fear."ok," i whisper, inching closer toward him, "tell me a secret, emerson.make it a good one, too.""all right," he says, his voice hoarse and low, "i haven't stopped thinking about you for two weeks straight.since the night of the party.i got to see a side of you that night i'd never seen before.in the closet, during that stupid game... you were so direct.so ready.and so fucking sexy.if the cops hadn't shown up, i don't know what would have happened.but i damn well know what i wanted to happen.""what?"i breathe, so close to him that i can feel his warm breath against my skin."what did you want to happen?"his eyes glint with something that looks like longing.lust.can this seriously be happening right now?is someone about to leap out from behind a houseplant and tell me i've been punk'd or what?"it would probably be better for me to show you than tell you," he growls."is that ok?"unable to formulate a single word, i simply nod my assent.with a fiery intensity i've never seen in him before, emerson catches my face in his broad hands.i can feel my heart barreling against my ribcage as he takes one long, steady look at me.before i can take another breath, he's brought his lips to mine in a searing, earnest kiss.the entire world shrinks down to our two bodies as i feel myself subsumed by the sensation.his lips are unbelievably soft, his mouth so strong as it works against mine.i open myself to him, closing my eyes in rapturous bliss as his tongue glances against my own.the taste of him electrifies my senses.in this moment, there is nothing but him.i gasp softly as emerson pulls me onto his lap.i straddle him, wrapping my arms around his shoulders as his tongue probes deeper and deeper.pressing myself flush against him, i let a low groan escape from between my lips.i can feel through his signature blue jeans that he's hard for me.the full, stiffening length of him presses against my sex, exactly where i've been dreaming of feeling him for the better part of four years.my body has never been this alive with want.not with anybody.moving with him feels intuitive in a way it never has with any other guy.i grind my hips slowly, feeling him grow even harder beneath me.his hands slide down over my ass, running along the firm rise in my jeans.he pulls me tighter, letting me feel just how much he wants me.in a moment of daring, i close my teeth around his bottom lip, tugging gently.he looks up at me in wonder."where the hell did you come from, abby?"he breathes."i've been here all along," i smile, running my hands through his chestnut hair."you just haven't noticed until now.""please," he chuckles, wrapping his arms around the small of my back, "you honestly think i never noticed you before?""well... You never said a word to me before our parents met," i point out, bringing my lips to his scruffy throat and kissing deeply."why would i?you were way out of my league," he replies, running his down my sides."i didn't want to risk making an ass of myself."i start laughing so hard that i nearly topple off of him."now that is hilarious," i crow, steadying myself."me?out of your league?""of course," he says, "can you seriously not see that?""all i can see right now is you, mr. drop dead gorgeous lacrosse star," i smile, feeling emboldened by his words."and since we're being honest, here... i've been carrying quite the torch for you these past four years.i've sort of been crushing on you from afar since... oh... the minute i saw you in school for the first time.""no shit?"he grins."no shit," i assure him."how messed up is it that we only figured this out because our parents started boning?"he laughs."ughh," i groan, rolling off of him onto the couch, "please don't talk about our parents having sex right now.or ever, for that matter.""fine by me," he says, shifting his body my way.without another word, he lays me out on the sofa, lowering his muscled body onto mine.he runs his index finger along my jaw, tipping my chin up toward his face."i don't want to talk right now anyway."he kisses me again, his hands roving all over my body.my back arches as he cups my breasts through my thin cotton tee shirt, letting his thumbs brush over my hard nipples.as he kneads and caresses me, a low, pulsing pressure starts to build in my core.i can't remember the last time i got off without my handy dandy vibrator.it's been ages since i've hooked up with anyone, and the intensity of the pleasure emerson is bestowing on me is almost too much to bear.almost."i've been dreaming of this for so long," i sigh, letting my head fall back against the couch cushions."you have no idea, emerson..." "oh, i think i do," he chuckles, pressing his hips against me, letting me feel that staggering length."is that the secret you were going to trade me for?""w-what?"i stammer, my eyes springing open."you know.a secret for a secret.like we said," emerson clarifies, propping himself up on his forearms."oh," i say softly, feeling the wonderful peace this evening has brought slipping away as the moment of my big reveal approaches."um.no, i-" "shit," he mutters, brushing a lock of hair away from my face, "i'm sorry.i'm totally killing the mood, here.i can't be trusted not to fuck up something as awesome as this.""you haven't fucked anything up," i insist, but it's too late.i can already see his expression darkening.i need to backpedal, right things before it's too late.deep dark secrets can wait for a spell.i need to show him that we're on the same page.and like emerson says, better to show than tell.without a word, i reach for his belt buckle, whipping it open with a metallic clank.emerson's eyes go wide as i slowly ease down the zipper of his jeans.i guide him onto his back, climbing on top of him as i work to release his member from his jeans.his hardness strains against the thick denim, ready to burst through- we both sit bolt upright as the sound of keys in the front door lock ring through the empty house.giddy giggles sound from beyond the door as emerson and i look at each other in abject horror.no more playing house for us.deb and dad are home."shit," emerson fumes, buckling in his staggering erection and covering his lap with a throw pillow."fucking shit.""it's ok.they'll never know," i assure him, smoothing down my hair."how would they ever even guess, right?i'll still be right down the hall, you know.this isn't over."we trade wary smiles as the front door bursts open.if i didn't know any better, i'd say that our parents are absolutely trashed.my dad all but carries deb over the threshold, humming some sort of ridiculous-vaguely familiar-marching tune.but taking a closer look, it's plain to see that they're just excited, not drunk at all.thank god for that.a two-for-one relapse is not what we need right now."abby!emerson!"deb squeals, kicking her high-heeled feet in the air as dad spins her around the foyer."i'm so glad you're both here!""you seem... glad," emerson says, his brow furrowed as he takes in the sight of our giggling parents."what's, uh... what's going on with you two?""did you win the lottery or something?"i wager a guess, trying not to think of what would have happened had they come home just a few seconds earlier."we did win the lottery, in a way," my dad beams, setting deb down at last.emerson and i trade baffled looks, overwhelmed by our parents' behavior, and the bizarre turn this evening has taken.between our mutual confessions and whatever's going on with dad and deb, i, for one, can't seem to get my bearings."you tell them the good news, baby," my dad urges deb, wrapping an arm around her slender waist."ok honey bear," she squeals, bouncing on the balls of her feet."abby, emerson.bob and i... well.let's just say we finally figured out what to get you guys for your birthdays.""and what's... that?"emerson asks cautiously.in answer, deb simply holds her left hand up for us to take a gander at.for a split second, i'm totally at a loss.that is, before i catch the sparkly glimmer shining off her ring finger.there on her hand is a rock the size of rhode island.an engagement ring, by the looks of it.the implications of her new accessory wallop me as i sit beside emerson, staring in horrified silence.deb's wearing an engagement ring."we're going to get you each a brand new sibling!we'll be one big, happy family at last!"she cries ecstatically."what the fuck are you talking about?"emerson says, springing to his feet.safe to say any lingering evidence of our blissful excitement is long gone."bob and i are going to get married, sweetie!"deb goes on, her smile wavering."we didn't want to upstage your eighteenth birthdays, though, so we're going to wait until the weekend after.""how thoughtful of you," emerson snarls, his face turning bright red."remind me to make sure and nominate you for mother of the year.""stop it," deb says, her eyes filling with angry tears."you don't get to ruin this moment for me.you're going to be happy for me, emerson.for once in your goddamn life.""yeah.i don't really see that happening," emerson scoffs, his walls and defenses springing back into place."at least tell your mother that you're happy for her, emerson," my dad says harshly.my eyes go wide at his tone.he never reprimands emerson for anything."already playing at being my old man, bob?"emerson says, with a cold smile that doesn't reach his eyes."hate to break it to you, but that ship sailed a long time ago.thanks for at least waiting until i'm a legal adult to pull this crap.that way i can bail on this shit show with no strings attached.""emerson, please," deb says plaintively, but it's no use.he's already turned his back and marched out the door once again.we hear his chevy start up and peel out of driveway.i blink back devastated tears, looking longingly after him.he could have at least taken me with him.after everything we shared this evening, everything we did... he said i could trust him.was that just another lie to get in my pants?no.of course not.he's just hurt by our parents' carelessness.hurt by what it means for us."are you going to say congratulations at least?"my dad asks me flatly, placing a comforting hand on deb's back."i... i don't..." i stammer, looking back and forth between them."i don't know what you want from me, dad.""that... is very disappointing," he replies, looking as hurt as i've ever seen him.but how the hell am i supposed to congratulate them on what is clearly nothing more than an impulsive, terrible decision?they barely even know each other.they're still in the early stages of recovery.what the hell are they thinking?"so ungrateful, both of them," deb mutters, marching up the stairs.dad heaves a sigh as she slams their bedroom door.an eerie silence falls over the house, punctuated only by deb's muffled sobs from upstairs.my dad and i look at each other across the wide open space.this is as alone as we've been in months, ever since deb showed up on the scene.i wish i could be honest with him right now, tell him how reckless he's being, tell him how much it hurts me to see him pick up with the first woman he meets without actually giving a shit about her.but i've never been able to call my dad out on his bad behavior."this is not how i saw tonight ending," he mutters, shaking his head."i just wish you would have asked us if we were ok with this," i say, frustrated tears stinging my eyes."excuse me," my dad replies, "since when do parents ask their children for permission?""i just... you hardly know her!she hardly knows you!"i exclaim."what is it you even love about her, dad?i mean, you do love her-?""of course i do," he says gruffly."i love how she looks.how she carries herself.her eyes.her hair.""seriously?"i ask, scoffing, "you like the way she looks?that's it?""you and emerson will be adults soon," my dad says firmly."before long, you'll know what it feels like to want something-someone-so badly that you're willing to do just about anything to be together.i hope you'll have the courage to make that leap when the time comes."i almost laugh as he spews theses words of wisdom.he practically just told me to go ahead and jump my soon-to-be-stepbrother's bones.but as absurd as this all is, i can't laugh at about it just yet.the pain is far too raw.there's a good chance it always will be.chapter five it's three in the morning before i hear emerson's car swing back into the driveway beneath my window.in the four hours or so he's been on the road blowing off steam, i haven't slept a wink.haven't even come close.my nerves have been on a hair-trigger, ready to snap clean in two, as i wait for him to return.the second i hear his car door slam, i throw off my covers and roll out of bed.crossing my arms over my chest and throwing my blonde hair into a messy ponytail, i pad over to my bedroom window and ease it open.leaning out into the warm spring air, i see emerson leaning heavily against the hood of his car, looking up at our house with despair."hey, emerson," i whisper, waving to get his attention."what are you doing up?"he murmurs back."what do you think?"i say, "i was waiting for you.stay there-i'm coming down.""you don't have to," he starts to say, but i've already turned away from the window.i take the stairs two at a time, not pausing long enough to be self-conscious about my tiny cotton shorts and camisole.i gently push open the front door and step out into the darkness of the very early morning.emerson watches as i cross the driveway toward him.he smiles wryly at my approach."are you trying to kill me with those shorts or what?"he says.though i know he's teasing, there's a frustrated, regretful hunger beneath his words that breaks my heart."some of us have been in bed for hours now," i remind him, leaning against the car by his side, "instead of rending our shirts and bellowing into the wind.or whatever it was you were doing out there.""that about sums it up," he replies."what, are you pissed at me?""it would have been nice to not be stuck alone with our parents after all that," i point out, "your mom cried for hours.""it's one of her favorite hobbies," emerson shrugs."you could have at least taken me with you," i shoot back."after everything..." "i know," he says, a small sigh escaping his lips."i'm not used to looking out for anyone besides myself, abby.i gave up on my mom years ago, and i guess when shit gets real i just look out for me.i'm sorry.""it's ok," i whisper, reaching for his hand.to my relief, he lets me take it."you're back now.that's what matters."he looks my way, his blue eyes gleaming even in the darkness.i can see a million thoughts swirling behind those eyes, afloat in a churning sea of turmoil and rage.i wish there was anything i could do to ease that pain.and maybe, just maybe, there is."come on," i say, tugging his hand, "let's go.""go where?"he asks, standing stock still."i'm exhausted, abby.""just follow me, sawyer," i reply, pretending impatience."unless you're too chicken shit, that is."he rolls his eyes with just enough playfulness to give me hope.without another word, i tow him away from the car.silently, we make our way around the perimeter of the house, the expansive back yard, the black water of the in-ground pool.i lead emerson along the edge of the woods that surround our property, peeling off down a well-worn dirt path.i expect his body to tense up as i drag him into the foliage, but he follows gamely.i suppose he doesn't scare so easy, emerson sawyer."here it is," i say, after a few minutes of trudging along through the underbrush.we've come to a stop before a thick, sturdy trunk, inlaid with wooden planks that serve as footholds.it's a place i've come to love and depend on as a safe haven.during the worst of mom and dad's fights, and later the worst of his drunken rages, this is where i'd come."what is'it'?"emerson asks, raising an eyebrow at the makeshift ladder."i'll show you," i tell him, grasping a plank and pulling myself up a foot."just don't check out my ass the whole time i'm climbing, now.""that... is not a fair request," he smiles, as i scurry up the trunk before him.i can feel his eyes raking along my body the whole while.and despite my instructions, i can't pretend that i mind too much.as we hit the point where the tree's branches begin to fan out, i pull myself onto a wide wooden platform, scooting over to make room for emerson beside me.this weathered deck was built to last, but it helps that i've maintained it over the years.it's not quite a treehouse, but it does the trick as far as secret hideaways go."well, this is rustic," emerson laughs, swinging himself up onto the platform to join me."did your dad make this?""my grandpa did, actually," i tell him, "back when my dad was still a kid.this was his and my grandma's house, before they passed it along to my mom and dad.""did they... pass away?your grandparents?"emerson asks gently."nah," i chuckle, "they just decided that florida was more their scene is all.didn't want to go through the hassle of selling this place.they're, uh, pretty well off, my grandparents.good people, but loaded as hell.""not a very typical combination, is it?"emerson replies gruffly.he looks over as me as i avert my eyes, embarrassed."sorry.i didn't mean you.i just-" "didn't you?"i ask softly."of course not," emerson says, reaching for my hand."i told you not four hours ago how i feel about you, abby.you're not just some rich girl to me.christ, i would never hold you accountable for your family.that would mean you could hold me accountable for mine.""good point.and i wouldn't dream of it, for the record," i laugh shortly."though apparently, we're about to have our shitty families joined in holy matrimony.so... congratulations to us?""or something," emerson grumbles, shaking his head."it's a terrible fucking idea.they don't even know each other.they're going to make each other miserable.""i know," i reply, heaving a sigh, "this is why marriage gets such a bad rap.because assholes like our parents fuck it up for everyone.""seriously," emerson says, pulling out a cigarette.i don't even have to ask for one this time, he just passes it my way.he holds the lighter for me as i run the tip of my cigarette through the flame.we inhale deeply in unison, peering up at the stars through the canopy of leaves above.our fingers are still entwined, natural as can be.that might be what hurts the most-the potential of a relationship that feels as easy as breathing, scattered by our parents' carelessness."it's not fair," i whisper, my eyes prickling with tears."no.it's not," emerson replies, pulling me tightly against his side."i mean jesus christ, their timing," i laugh, though nothing about this is funny."no kidding," he replies, "if they hadn't shown up when they did... abby, i don't know what would have happened back there.i mean.i know what i wanted to happen.""and... what's that?"i ask softly, unable to look him in the eye."i think you know," he says, circling my waist with his muscled arm."but what i don't know, at least for sure, is what you want out of this.out of... us."my heart is lodged in my throat as i think of how to answer.i need to be bold now.to tell him the truth.even if i've read him entirely wrong, and he thinks i'm insane for what i'm about to say, we'll be out of each others' lives in a few months' time.so, here goes."if we hadn't been interrupted," i say, softly but steadily, "i wouldn't have stopped until we'd had each other.that's all i wanted."he glances down at me, and i force myself to meet his gaze.his eyes smolder with wanting me.the intensity of his lust nearly bowls me over."that's what i wanted, too," he growls, catching my chin in his hand.he brings his mouth to mine, kissing me forcefully, deeply.but there's a hint of finality in his kiss that nearly brings me to tears."what are we supposed to do?"i whisper, pulling away from him."it's wednesday.no, thursday now.by sunday, we'll technically be siblings.""i know that," emerson replies, his teeth gritted in hopeless frustration."and once that's the case, we can't..." "i know," i whisper."of course we can't.it wouldn't be right.""nothing about this situation is right," he scoffs."god," i mutter, "why couldn't we have just found each other years ago, before we were out of time?""we're not out of time.yet," emerson says carefully, as if testing the waters.my heart clenches tightly as he goes on."tomorrow is my birthday, abby.saturday is yours.that means that on saturday, and only on saturday, we'll both be legal adults.legal, unrelated adults.who can argue with that?""are you... are you suggesting...?"i reply, my eyes going wide."if i don't at least suggest it," emerson says, pulling me into his lap."i'll regret it for the rest of my life.so, yes.this is me telling you that i want you, abby.i want to be with you.i want us to have each other, if only once in our lives.i'm suggesting that we give ourselves that before it's too late.you can tell me i'm nuts, or to go fuck myself, or whatever you like.but i have to at least tell you... that that's what i want.""well, emerson," i say, struggling to take a deep breath, "that's convenient.because i... want that... too."we stare at each other for a long moment before bursting into uproarious laughter.gut-bursting, tension-relieving, hysterical laughter that almost sends us both toppling off the platform at once.i throw my arms around emerson's shoulders as we both roar at the insane, absurd hilarity of this whole situation.a wave of relief crashes through me as laugher wracks my body.god, it feels good to let some of this pressure release."that might be the most awkward thing i've ever said in my life!"i crow, wiping tears from my eyes."this may be the most awkward conversation that's ever occurred between two people," emerson replies, "'hey, i know you're about to be my sister, but i really want to do you."'that sets us off again.we collapse into each other until we end up lying on our backs, chests heaving, staring up at the stars.our hands are clasped, our smiles wide.despite the crapiness of the whole situation, here we are together.on the same page."promise me it will happen," i say to him."promise me that on my birthday, we'll get to be together.the way we want to be.""i promise," emerson says, giving me a sweet, chaste kiss on the forehead."but.um.i hope you don't mind if i ask another sort of awkward question," emerson goes on, his fingers tightening ever-so-slightly."shoot," i tell him, turning my head his way."well.you know, i'm no novice, when it comes to sex," he begins, delightfully blunt as ever."i've been with a few girls in my time.but in your case... i guess what i mean is... have you ever...?"my smiles fades at once as i jerk my face away from his.he senses my entire body tense up in the wake of his question."shit," he groans, "that was so stupid of me-" "no," i cut him off, steeling myself for what i have to say, now."no, it wasn't stupid.it's just... not an easy question for me to answer.that doesn't mean i'm not going to, it's just... bear with me."he squeezes my hand, but doesn't say a word.i take a breath and go on."i was going to tell you this earlier.when we were trading secrets.i wanted to explain what happened at the diner tonight, but i was afraid that you... anyway.the short answer to your question is, yes, i've had sex before.the slightly longer answer is that i didn't really want to.didn't want to at all, actually.""oh, abby..." emerson says, his voice as soft as i've ever heard it."do you mean-?""it was back in freshman year," i go on, plowing ahead before i lose my nerve."i was sort of a late bloomer, so i was really only beginning to get attention from some guys at our school.there was one in particular that i'd had a crush on since about kindergarten.he and i were at the other middle school, not yours.anyway, he teased me pretty mercilessly through eighth grade-for being smart, for always having my nose in a sketchbook, all that.but come high school, that teasing gave way to flirting.and we started, uh, hanging out.right when my mom died, he was still sort of in the picture.we weren't dating or anything, but we were spending time together.i went over to his place one night when my dad was wasted, just to get out of the house for a minute.his parents were away, so it was just us.he'd broken into his dad's liquor cabinet and offered me something to drink.said it would make me feel better.i had some booze, he gave me more.he over-poured my drinks.i got drunk.then he started touching me, pushing me further than we'd been before.by then, we'd only really kissed.but he was feeling me up, trying to undress me.i told him to stop, i was too wasted to enjoy it, to want it.but he kept on me.said that would make me feel better, too.he was much bigger than me, and i was so far gone.i passed out in the struggle.when i woke up a few hours later, i was naked from the waist down.he was asleep.passed out.there was some blood on my thighs, and... you know... everything else.i got dressed, went home, and took a shower.he and i never spoke again.the only other person who knows this besides you is riley.but i need you to know.it's important to me that you do."a heavy, thick cloud of silence descends as emerson's jaw pulses with rage."this guy," he says, his voice ragged, "it was tucker.wasn't it?""yes," i whisper, "yes.it was.""abby, i'm so sorry," emerson says, "i'm so sorry that happened to you.i'm sorry no one was there to help you.if i'd known-" "what, you would have beat him up for me?"i tease, trying to force a little bit of levity into my confession."for starters," emerson says resolutely."that wouldn't fix anything," i reply."even if i'd told someone, no one would have believed me.i only would have gotten a reputation for being a lying whore at school.with his popularity, his family's reputation in town... i wouldn't have stood a chance.i'd rather get to leave this place behind and forget about every one of these assholes than give them the satisfaction of dragging me through the mud.""i just... i wish there was anything i could do for you," emerson says, "to make things better.anything.""this is a pretty good start," i tell him, giving his hand a squeeze."we can't change the past, you know.but we do get to decide what the future looks like.""right," he says softly, tucking my hair behind my ear."you're right."the sky is just starting to lighten overhead as we make our way back inside.we have school later today, as mundane as it is to think of.we pause at the top of the stairs, just before peeling off toward our own rooms.emerson lays his hands on my bare upper arms, looking at me intently."thank you for telling me everything," he whispers, "it means so much that you can trust me with that.""i'd trust you with anything," i reply, taking his face in my hands.standing on my tiptoes, i kiss him earnestly, swiftly.this time, he doesn't hold what i want just out of reach.we step away from each other and dart into our rooms.as my face hits the pillow at last, i realize the enormity of everything that's come to pass in these last 24 hours.the diner incident.the impromptu date night and steamy make out session with emerson.dad and deb's big announcement.my confession to emerson.our agreement for my eighteenth birthday."man," i sigh, drifting off to sleep, "i'd better give this to riley in small doses, or else she's going to lose her shit.permanently."chapter six sure enough, my best friend is flabbergasted and delighted when i give her the scoop of all that's gone down with me since last we spoke.we've decided to spend gym class huddled at the top of the football field bleachers, now that our teacher has given up on trying to make us participate in class.it's a good thing, too, because the squeal that riley emits when i let her in on my and emerson's plans for saturday would be enough to burst any unaccustomed eardrums."what the fucking fuck?!"she shrieks, shoving her hands through her black curls."this is too much.in the best way possible.where is it gon na go down?what are you gon na wear?what if the sex is just too good and you have to rush off and elope just to beat your parents to the punch so that they're the fucked up ones?what if-?""whoa, whoa.slow down, tiger," i laugh, "neither of us expects this to be a long term thing.it can't be, with our parents getting married.we'd probably hardly even see each other after graduation, anyway, even if they weren't tying the knot.this is a onetime thing.a gift to ourselves.please don't get your hopes up for some happy ending.""who do you think you're talking to?"she scoffs, "my imagination can wring a happy ending out of any situation.i'm holding out hope for you two.""i wish i had your optimism then," i laugh."really, i do.""and i can't believe you told him about... you know," she says, growing somber."you must really trust this guy, huh?""i know it's crazy, but i really do," i tell her."it might blow up in my face and ruin me for life, but hey, nothing's been able to ruin me yet.so, i like my chances.""see?you're plenty optimistic," riley says, raising an eyebrow."well.optimistic-ish."later that evening, i'm curled up on the couch going through some mind-numbing calculus homework.i have my headphones in, trying to drown out deb and dad's pre-wedding chatter with some kings of leon.they're huddled over the kitchen table, going over the last-minute plans for their spur-of-the-moment wedding ceremony and honeymoon.i can't even think about how excruciating it will be for emerson and i to be alone here for the whole week of their honeymoon, unable to touch each other ever again.maybe riley will let me crash at her place.or i guess i could just invest in a chastity belt."hey honey!"deb chirps happily as emerson strolls in through the front door.i look up as he enters and tug out an earbud, in case we're all about to have a family meeting."hi mom," he replies shortly.to my surprise, he makes a beeline to where i'm sitting on the couch and plops down next to me.i feel unaccountably nervous to be near him in our parents' presence.what if they can sense what's gone on between us?but of course, they're oblivious to the end.for once, their narcissism is working in our favor."our best man and maid of honor, here together," deb goes on, clasping her manicured hands in elation."when did that get decided?"i ask under my breath."don't look at me," emerson replies, "it's the first i'm hearing of it.""we'll need you kids up bright and early on sunday morning," my dad calls over to us."we've got the justice of the peace booked from noon until half past.got ta make it snappy.""how romantic," i observe."and guess what else," dad goes on, his cheerfulness dwindling just a hair, "grandma jillian and grandpa frank are going to be here to celebrate.""really?"i ask, raising my eyebrows.my grandparents, frank and jillian rowan, adore me, but their relationship with my dad is rather spotty.grandpa frank is pretty critical of my dad's history of "freeloading" off their old money."they insisted," my dad smiles tightly.it's actually something of a comfort that dad doesn't get along with his parents, either.just goes to show that it runs in the family.grandma and grandpa have been supporting our little family since i was born.they really adored my mom, sandy, and pretty clearly thought she was doing my dad a favor by sticking around.most of the money for my schooling, clothing, and extracurriculars still comes from them.they've even offered to pay my way through college.well, whatever i can't cover with scholarships, that is."well.i'll be sure to get to the church on time," emerson says with sarcastic enthusiasm."but i won't be around much beforehand.""what?"i ask, whipping around to face him.what the hell is he talking about?he has to be around."what do you mean, emerson?"deb presses her son."a friend of mine is throwing me an eighteenth birthday party at his parents' beach house this weekend.a whole bunch of people are going to be there," emerson says casually."is that so?"i whisper, my stomach flipping over.he's ditching me, and our rather important plans, to hang out at the beach?"oh... well, that's nice!"deb smiles."you've always been such a popular boy, emerson.it's good that you'll be with your friends on your birthday.""uh-huh," emerson says, examining his fingernails."guess it'll just be the three of us celebrating your birthday then, abby," my dad says."so it would seem," i reply, glaring at emerson.i can feel a hard knot forming in my throat.was he just messing with me last night, when he told me that he wanted me?has he been telling all his friends about how his pervy almost-stepsister secretly wants to jump his bones?i can't believe i let my guard down.i should know better than to trust anyone at all."actually, you know what?"emerson says, finally shifting his gaze my way, "my friends probably wouldn't mind too much if you tagged along, abby.i've got a spare seat in the car.""you... i... what?"i stammer, uncomprehendingly."oh, you should go, abby!"deb says enthusiastically, "you don't want to hang out with us old farts on your birthday.go have fun with emerson and his friends!don't you think she should, bob?""sure," my dad says, "sounds like it could be a fun time for you kids.""what do you say, abby?"emerson asks.there's a glint in his blue eyes, a spark of secrecy.i don't quite know what he's up to, or why he's scrapped our plans for the weekend, but anything would be better than being stuck here alone with our parents on my birthday."ok," i say flatly, leaning back against the couch."sounds... great.""as long as you're on time for the wedding," my dad reminds us warningly."super," emerson grins, snatching away the bag of milano cookies i've been noshing on."we'll leave tomorrow after school.get as much out of the weekend as we can.""sounds good, bro," i say, glowering at him as he steals my snack."oh, isn't that just so precious?"deb grins, as emerson disappears upstairs.i watch his retreating back, my mind reeling.i'm hurt, and confused, and incredibly disappointed about our plans being scattered.how can he think it's ok to just blow me off like this, after everything i shared with him last night?it doesn't make any sense.he seemed just as eager to have some... alone time together as i did.what the hell gives?my concentration has been absolutely demolished.there's no way i'm getting any more homework done today.unwilling to listen to my parents' sickly-sweet chatter, i head up to my own room, lock the door, and whip out my battery-operated boyfriend.if i'm not going to get any action this weekend after all, i'd better stock up on the self love every chance i get.i'm well accustomed to taking care of myself, anyway.still smarting from emerson's dismissal, i leave for the school the next morning without even sticking around to wish him a happy birthday.i halfway expect the rest of the student body to burst out laughing as i hurry into school, convinced that emerson will have spread the word about what a dramatic weirdo i am.but as usual, my entrance into homeroom goes unnoticed by all my peers save riley.my best friend waves me over, noticing at once that i'm in a terrible mood."what's wrong?"she asks, as i sit down beside her."oh, you know," i sigh, "just everything in the entire world."without a word, she takes my hand and tows me toward the classroom door.our teacher, a beleaguered, balding man in his forties, looks up from his game of computer solitaire as we march past."excuse me," he says testily."where do you ladies think you're going?"without missing a beat, riley spins around to face him, plants a hand on her hip, and says, "we both just got our periods simultaneously.they're super heavy too.like, horror-movie level.so we're gon na go take care of our woman issues together.ok?bye!"the teacher's face drains of color as we traipse out of the room and slam the door behind us.the rest of our schoolmates are in their classrooms already, so we're all alone as we beat a quick path through the halls and hole up in one of the girls' bathrooms.we squeeze ourselves into one of the larger stalls and settle down for a good long talk.riley cracks a window so that she can enjoy a gossip-session cigarette, and i tell her about emerson's surreptitious change of plans for the weekend."that doesn't make any sense," she says, putting her smoke out on the windowsill."tell me about it!"i exclaim, letting my head fall back against the tile wall."there's got to be more to it," she says resolutely."why would he all but profess his love for you one night-?""he professed his wanting to bone me," i correct her, "not his love.""right," riley says, rolling her eyes, "why would he profess his whatever, only to leave you high and dry?doesn't follow.""you're the expert on man-brains," i reply, "you tell me what i'm supposed to make of all this.""just wait it out," she tells me, resting her hands on my shoulders."i'm sure there's an explanation, here."having unloaded some of my frustration, i feel like i can at least make it through the rest of the day without exploding.we'll see how i feel once i'm cooped up in some beach house with a bunch of emerson's buddies.as i step out of the girl's bathroom with riley right behind me, i very nearly crash into a wall of person that appears out of nowhere."christ," i mutter, stepping out of the way just in time."watch where you're-" "there you are," a very familiar voice says."i was looking for you."i glance up only to find emerson's blue eyes looking back at me.i do my best to tamp down my automatic excitement at seeing him.can't let him get me all riled up, now."oh?"i say, feigning indifference."and why were you looking for me?""because we're getting out of here," he replies, as if it's the most obvious thing in the world."right now.let's go.""i thought you said we were heading out after school?"i reply, even more confused."i say a lot of things," emerson shrugs, "but right now, i'm saying that you and i are getting in my chevy and blowing this pop stand.what, are you afraid to miss math class or something, miss rowan?""don't be an ass," i mutter."if you're so hell-bent on leaving now, fine.it's your freakin' birthday, after all.""that's the spirit," he grins, turning on his heel."let's go, sis."he walks away toward the student parking lot, and i turn to stare at riley, bewildered."what are you waiting for?"she whispers, giving me a little push, "go with him!""all right, all right," i mutter, and set off after emerson.i've never straight-up ditched school before, but i can't let him see that i'm nervous about this little operation.struggling to appear cool as a cucumber, i duck through the front doors on his heels and hurry over to his chevy.holding my breath as i slide into the passenger seat, it occurs to me as strange that there's no one else hitching a ride with us.i thought we'd be transporting at least a couple of emerson's meat head friends to the beach with us.emerson steers the chevy out of the school parking lot, and for a moment it seems that we're totally in the clear.that is, until the security guard at the front gates looks up from his crossword puzzle with a scowl."you might want to duck down in your seat a little," emerson tells me.i obey, without daring to ask why.the security guard lumbers out of his hutch, signaling for us to stop.emerson eases up on the gas as we approach, rolling toward the gates.but just as we're coming up on the school guard, my reckless companion floors it.with a rabid whirr of the engine, we fly past the baffled guard and swing out onto the main road out of town.i swallow down a terrified yelp as i watch our school shrink behind us in the rearview mirror."desperate times, right?"emerson laughs, slapping the steering wheel with his palms."i don't understand why you're so desperate to get to some stupid house party," i grumble, crossing my arms."even if it is in honor of your birthday."emerson raises an eyebrow at me, an amused grin spreading across his face."holy shit, abby," he crows, laughing at my surly expression."you are, hands down, the most gullible person on the planet.did you seriously think-?""what?"i ask, sitting up a little straighter, "did i think what?""did you seriously think i was going to blow off what we planned for some stupid birthday party?damn.i must be a better liar than i thought," he chuckles, pulling out a cigarette.my heart inflates like a helium balloon as i catch his drift."you mean," i breathe, "we're still on?for...?""of course we're still on," he says, glancing my way."you think i'd actually miss the chance to follow through on my promise to you?you must be out of your damn mind, lady.""but then why-?what-?"i stammer, smiling despite myself."i had to feed bob and deb that house party bullshit," he explains, turning off onto the highway ramp."they may be the two most oblivious, self-centered people on the continent, but even they would have been suspicious if their teenage son and daughter had announced they were going off on a romantic seaside retreat together.""you know something sawyer," i say, beaming at his brilliance, "you're a lot smarter than you look.""wish i could say the same for you," he scoffs playfully."i can't believe you fell for that whole thing.""guess my heart is just too pure and wholesome for my own good," i kid, fluttering my eyelashes daintily."or you're just gullible as hell," emerson replies, cranking up the radio and laying on the speed as we soar along the highway.in a matter of minutes, my heart has been entirely mended.emerson had no intention of abandoning me after all, and certainly didn't run off and spread my secrets around the school behind my back.but as happy as i am to be back on track with him, a little part of me is worried about the intensity of my reaction to the mere idea of losing him.his smallest action has the power to send me soaring to new heights of bliss or drag me down to devastating lows.i've never intentionally let someone hold that much sway over my heart and mind.never cared so much for someone to the point of trusting them so fully.i have every reason to think that i can trust emerson not to hurt me.but clearly, i'm having trouble putting any weight on that faith in him.i can't go into this half-heartedly.if i make the choice to trust him, be vulnerable and open with him, then i've got to charge full speed ahead.the quickest way to ruin this thing we've got is to hold back from each other.we both risked a lot even telling each other how we feel.we've come so close to breaking through each others' iron-clad defenses.it's time to lower the walls once and for all.as we race along in emerson's chevy, i reach for his hand.without missing a beat, he gives my hand a squeeze, letting me know that i'm safe and sound with him.if i'm honest with myself, i've known that all along.and that might be the scariest part of this whole thing.chapter seven at least one part of emerson's story was true-we are, in fact, spending the weekend at the beach.only, instead of shacking up with a bunch of other kids in someone's rich parents' beach house, we're staying in a tiny motel in a room of our own.i tease emerson as we pull up to the place."a motel?seriously?"i smile, grabbing my backpack."bit of a cliche, isn't it?""i can set up a tent on the beach if you'd rather," he shoots back, "but this place has hbo.so i hope you won't mind if i don't join you."we get our keys from the front office, only drawing a slightly suspicious look from the man behind the desk.but hey, emerson's eighteen now, and has the id to prove it.that'll take a little getting used to-the whole being able to do whatever we please thing.it may not be a huge deal, booking a motel room of our own, but it's cool all the same.it's a taste of adult independence, and damn is it thrilling.though not nearly as thrilling as what's set to go down in said motel room, that's for damn sure.we find our room at the end of a long line of doors.the motel sits right on the edge of the dunes overlooking the long island sound.the spring air is just cool enough to be refreshing, and the sun is just beginning to set over the water.emerson pushes open our door, and we step over the threshold together.my reservations about staying in a motel evaporate as i take in the space.it's a quaint, simple room, well kept and cozy.i spot a deep bathtub through the open bathroom door, a huge window with a view of the sea... and a big queen bed right in the center of the room.seeing that big-enough-for-two bed makes this whole thing real for me.i'm finally going to sleep with emerson sawyer.after all these years of wanting him from afar, he's right here beside me.we're here with each other.it's almost too good to be true.don't think that, i chide myself, the second you think something's too good to be true, it usually is."well," emerson says with a smile."i'm starving.you gon na take me out for a birthday dinner or what?""since you asked so nicely," i roll my eyes, "sure.where do you want to go?"he knows a place nearby, and drives us over to get some grub.it's a tiny, seaside shack with maybe a dozen tables.the menu is heavy on seafood and regional staples.there's a warmth to the place that can only be captured during the offseason at a sleepy beach town.in short, it's perfect.we settle down into a table by the window and tuck into our complementary basket of biscuits.the buttery, flaky pastry makes my eyes flutter closed with pleasure.i haven't eaten anything all day."how'd you know about this place?"i ask emerson, perusing the menu."my dad used to take me here when i was little," he replies, looking out the wide front windows toward the docks."we'd come out fishing early in the morning, then stop here for lunch before driving home.it's not fancy, but it's one of my favorite places in the world."his face takes on a cast of sadness as he talks about his dad.it occurs to me that i barely know anything about emerson's father, or what happened to him.i try to open up the conversation as delicately as possible."does he still live around here, your dad?"i ask carefully, reaching for another biscuit."in a way," emerson laughs roughly."i mean, he's still in the state.or should i say, in state.""your dad's... incarcerated?"i ask, pausing in my one-woman biscuit-scarfing contest."you don't have to be so formal about it," emerson replies."he's locked up.has been for most of my life.""wow..." i breathe, unsure of what to say."that's... so rough.i'm sorry.""i'm pretty used to the arrangement by now," he says."but thanks.""do you mind if i ask... i mean, you don't have to go into it..." i fumble."no, it's ok," emerson replies, "you've told me so much about your past, it's only fair that i be open with you too."we pause our conversation long enough to place our orders with the young, friendly waitress.once she's taken our menus away and left us alone once more emerson takes a breath and begins."my parents got married pretty young," he tells me, "for a while, they really were happy.they never had much in the way of money, but when you look at old pictures of them, it always looks like they're having a blast.it wasn't until they started trying to start a family that things got sort of... complicated.""complicated how?"i ask."complicated in that it didn't work for them at first," emerson goes on."they kept trying to get pregnant without any luck.their doctors told them that fertility treatments, ivf and all, might help things along.the problem is, those treatments cost money, and my parents didn't have any.but they were hell bent on having a kid, so my dad-peter-decided to get a little creative with the whole money-making thing.""and when you say creative..." i prompt him."i mean he started selling drugs to make some extra money," emerson says bluntly."nothing major.just weed, mostly.and it worked, too-they were able to rake in enough extra cash that ivf was suddenly on the table.my mom was finally able to get pregnant with yours truly.which was all well and good, until i was eight or so.that's when the dealing finally caught up with my dad.he wasn't just selling the drugs.both my parents had already started having issues with substance abuse by then, and my dad got in a really nasty car accident while under the influence that brought everything out into the open.he went away, my mom got worse, and i was left to take care of it all.i did, too.i have been since i was eight.i mean, it's because they wanted me so badly that they started down that road at all.it only seems fair, you know?""emerson," i say softly, reaching for his hands across the table, "you know that none of that is your fault, right?""oh, sure," emerson shrugs, "i know that.in theory.but it's hard not to feel kind of obligated to them now, no matter how badly they mess up.""i know what you mean," i nod, "i feel the same way about my dad.like, since he lost mom, i always have to be there for him, even if he barely gives me the time of day.""look at us," emerson laughs, "a couple of bleeding hearts.""i guess so," i smile.our bountiful plates of food arrive-crab cakes for emerson, vegetable pot pie for me-and we dig in eagerly, plowing through every bite of buttery, flavorful goodness.we even go in for a couple slices of blueberry pie to top things off.i'm surprised we don't roll out of the restaurant at the end of our meal.by the time we make it back to the motel, we're happy, sleepy, and more than a little handsy.my every nerve sizzles with anticipation as emerson unlocks our motel room love nest and walks in before me.he flops onto the soft queen bed, and i tentatively ease myself down next to him.the whole being-alone thing is still so novel for us that i find myself feeling a little shy.emerson can sense that i'm still getting my bearings, so he just lets me curl against his side there on the bed.his arms close around me as i press my back against his chest.we drift into a post-dinner nap, the sound of the waves cocooning us as we lay there.even in half-slumber, i can feel my body responding to emerson's.our chests rise and fall together, our limbs shifting to accommodate each other.it's so simple, so easy.like we were built for each other.by all rights, i should be feeling so much pressure and anxiety about what we've promised to give each other this weekend.but i've never felt more at peace.i don't know how much time goes by before i turn myself to face emerson there on the bed.his blue eyes ease open as i lay my head next to his on the pillow.our mouths twist into matching grins as he runs a hand along the curve of my waist, and i rest my hands on his chest.without a word, he brings his lips to my neck, kissing me slow and deep.my back arches as his lips move down my throat, across my clavicle, over my chest.my blonde hair is splayed across the pillow beneath me as i writhe blissfully at his touch.i run my fingers through his tousled chestnut hair, tugging him closer toward me.as i press myself flush against his body, i can feel that he's growing harder by the second, just from kissing me.god, that's hot.his lips continue to caress every inch of skin they can find as he slips his hand beneath my gray sweater.the touch of his hand is cool against my flushed skin as he trails up my flat stomach, the tips of his fingers brushing against my ribs.i hold my breath as i feel him reach around my back and unclasp my bra with a flick of his wrist."someone's had a lot of practice with bra clasps," i tease breathlessly."what can i say," he grins, "i've have very capable hands."he finally brings his lips to mine as he cups my breast in his hand, running his thumb ever-so-lightly over my hard nipple.that slight touch sends a pang of desire straight into my core, radiating out through my entire body.his tongue glances against mine, and i kiss him back, deeper and more urgently with every passing moment.i feel his hand skirting along my torso as i let my own fingers trail down the hard, rippling line of his abs.he groans softly as i trace the length of his stiff member through his jeans.i take a deep breath as emerson pops open the button of my jeans.pulling me close, he slips his hand between my jeans and panties.my sex is aching for his touch, and i can't help but let my knees fall apart, spreading my legs wider for him.his fingertips brush against the thin panel of cotton covering me, already wet with desire for him.i grab onto handfuls of bedding as he pushes aside my panties and rests two strong fingers against my throbbing sex."emerson," i breathe, my head falling back against the pillow as he traces a long, slow line along my slit.i can't form any other word besides his name, whisper it over and over again as he strokes me, parting me a little deeper each time.i bury my face in his chest as he roves along my sex, laying those two expert fingers against the hard nub of my clit.i've never been touched like this by a guy, never gotten off with anything that wasn't battery-operated before.for the briefest moment, i worry about whether or not i'll be able to come with him.that is, before he starts tracing long, slow circles around that bundle of nerves, rubbing with just the right amount of force.a sweet, aching pressure starts to build in my core as he picks up the pace, rubbing and flicking my clit in a way i've never felt before.my back arches as he goes on, switching up speed and motion just at the right moment, never leaving me hanging for a second.my mouth falls open with wonder as i reach my tipping point.i'm right on the edge of spilling over with pleasure when he says : "come for me, abby."and i do, a shudder of bliss rolls through my body as i clutch onto him with all my might.i've had orgasms of my own creation before, but never have i come with another person.and certainly not for another person.spent, i fall back against the bed, my chest heaving.emerson lays down beside me, resting a hand on my stomach."holy shit..." i breathe, "i think you've killed me.""i couldn't help myself," he murmurs, "nothing turns me on like seeing you let go.it's the sexiest thing, abby.you have no idea.""so then... are we gon na...?"i ask, glancing down at his gorgeous body."nope.we already decided on tomorrow," he grins mischievously, "that was just to hold you over.""what?!"i exclaim, "but-" "we're sticking to the plan," he says firmly."tomorrow, when you're no longer a the younger woman, it'll be a different story.""ugghh," i groan, burying my face in my hands."guess you have a lot more will power than i do, then," i tell him."i like the thrill of the chase," he grins."hey," i say, with mock sternness, "don't torment me, now, or i won't give you your real birthday present.""you got me a present?"he asks, seeming genuinely touched."it's nothing, really," i reply, wanting to temper his expectations some."just... i thought you might like it, so..." "well, come on then!"he exclaims, sitting upright, "show me the goods!""aren't you supposed to be a grownup now or something, emerson?"i shoot back, feigning impatience as i swing my feet over onto the floor.really, i think his enthusiasm is downright adorable."nah.i don't plan on being a grownup anytime soon.being a legal adult isn't going to change that," he declares."hey, we should drink to that.""drink?"i ask, as i grab my backpack off the floor."i know your dad just keeps this stuff in the house for company," emerson goes on, snatching up his own overnight bag, "so i figured he wouldn't mind if we pilfered some.dude had, like, twenty bottles in the basement.how's that for willpower?"i watch as emerson produces a bottle of champagne, and can't help but giggle."how fancy of you," i say."what?doesn't champagne in a motel room just scream class to you?"he shoots back, searching around his bag for an opener."or something like that," i say, my fingers finally closing around the sketchbook i've been hunting for.i pull out the thick, weathered book as emerson pops open the bottle and pours us each a styrofoam cup of the bubbly."here you go, ma'am," he smiles, handing me some champagne."to not becoming grownups until they literally force us to," he says, holding up his cup."here, here!"i laugh, touching the lip of my cup to his.the fizzy wine tickles my nose as i take a sip, savoring the sweetness."thanks for the booze, dad," i add, tipping my cup in the general direction of our hometown."oh no," emerson groans, glancing down at my hands, "tell me you didn't get me a book for my birthday.""first of all, what's so bad about getting a book as a present?that's, like, the best present on the planet," i reply, and before he can protest i add, "secondly, it's not a book.it's just in a book.here..." he watches as i peel open the well-loved pages.somehow, this feels nearly as intimate as what just went down between us on the bed.i hardly ever show my sketchbook to anyone, yet here i am, flipping through the pages as emerson looks on.sharing my art with someone has always felt impossible, something that required far too much trust for me to be able to do.but emerson's teaching me that trust isn't something that's off-limits to me just because of my history.and i'm even starting to believe him."are those all yours?"he asks, his eyes glued to the pages."yep," i reply, "all of them.""they're amazing," he says reverently, as i linger on a drawing of a stylized, distorted landscape."please tell me you're going to major in art when you go to school in the fall.""oh, i don't know," i demur, "i might try and focus on something a little more practical.""fuck practical.these are incredible drawings," he exclaims."well... who knows?"i allow, "it's not like there are any real jobs out there anyway, right?might as well major in something i actually like.""that's the spirit.i think," emerson replies.finally, i come to the sketch i've been looking for.it's right at the end of the book, my most recent finished piece.drawing a steadying breath, i turn the sketchbook around and pass it to emerson.his eyes fall on the elaborate sketch and go wide.he drinks in the image for a long moment before finally looking up at me."is this...?"he asks."it is," i assure him, smiling at his amazement."it's you."we study the drawing together.it's a portrait of emerson i've been working on for weeks, since our first heated exchange at that party.the drawing shows him in half-profile, staring with determined purpose from the page.i'm really proud of how i was able to capture him, and i can tell he's impressed with the effort."this is how you see me?"he asks, his voice surprisingly soft."absolutely," i tell him."to me, that's the essence of who you are.intelligent, strong, unwilling to back down from what you know is right.from the things you want out of life.""can i... can i keep this?"he asks, looking up at me imploringly."of course!"i tell him, "it's for you, emerson.i want you to have it, always."placing the sketchbook down with great reverence, emerson leans forward and catches my lips in his."thank you," he murmurs, running a hand through my hair."it's the best gift anyone's ever given me."i smile and lower myself onto my knees in front of him."then you're going to love this..." i say with my best seductive grin.i slowly undo his belt and unzip his pants as he leans back, a look of utter disbelief on his face.i can see the hardening outline of his staggering cock growing down the inside of his jeans and my mouth begins to water instinctively.oh how i've dreamed of this moment.my heart feels like its going to beat out of my chest as he lifts his hips and i pull down his jeans and boxers, unleashing his throbbing dick.it's beautiful, i've never seen one up close before, and his is absolutely amazing.i grab it reverently, without thinking, and lower my mouth onto him, taking as much of emerson into my throat as possible... chapter eight when the early morning light draws me back up from the depths of slumber, i'm surprised to find that the bed beside me is empty.i roll onto my side, peering around the hotel room for my missing companion.even after one night, the feel of waking up without him doesn't suit me.i'm just about to roll out of bed and go searching for him when the motel room door eases open.emerson appears on the threshold, carrying two cups of takeout coffee and a paper bag.he sees me sitting up in bed and freezes."shit," he mutters."good morning to you too," i say, raising an eyebrow."no, it's just... I was going to surprise you," he says, closing the door behind him."here-just pretend to be asleep.""emerson..." i moan."come on," he pleads, turning his back to dump the contents of the bag onto the dresser."for me.please."i flop back onto the bed and pull the covers over my head as emerson futzes with something across the room.i hear the click of a lighter, the crinkling of the bag, and finally emerson saying, "ok. open your eyes."pulling the covers down ever-so-slightly, i feel my heart melt into a puddle of goo in my chest.emerson is walking toward me with a little makeshift breakfast in bed.there's my coffee, some creamers, and a blueberry muffin with a couple candles in the shape of a 1 and 8.he places the tray in my lap with great ceremony, humming the happy birthday song."go on.make a wish before it gets all waxy," he instructs me.i glance up at him, wondering what on earth else i can wish for now that he's barreled into my life.i wish that this all works out... i think to myself.somehow.i blow out the candles, and emerson sits down next to me on the bed, his own coffee and muffin hand."what did you wish for?"he asks."i'll tell you... if it ever comes true," i smile."fair enough," he says."happy birthday, abby.""thank you," i say, peeling the wrapper off my muffin."adulthood is off to a pretty great start, don't you think?"the day only gets better from there.after i treat myself to a long, hot bath and get dressed for the afternoon, emerson and i head down to the beach for a long walk.we take our time, talking all the while about our pasts, our ideas, our notions about the future.emerson's planning on going to college, eventually.but probably not this year.i'll be starting school in the fall, of course, but we don't talk too much about that part-the never-seeing-each-other again part.maybe we can find some way around the distance, if this whole thing doesn't go up in flames.but we'll be step-siblings tomorrow, so maybe it will be better to stay away after all.we don't talk about that too much, either.there's a little town center with shops and cafes down the shore a little ways, and emerson lets me take my time window shopping.i'm not much for designers or labels, but i love vintage and handmade things.there's one store in particular that i go nuts for-a local artist's shop that's chock full of gorgeous, eclectic jewelry and handicrafts.i fall in love with one piece especially-a slender silver ring the bears a single pearl.it's so elegant, so simple... and unfortunately out of my price range.but still, a girl can dream.we spend the day wandering around the sleepy beach town, grabbing ice cream and coffee later on, sitting on the sand together, daring to dunk our toes in the still-icy water.i field a few texts from riley, who claims "i told you so" right when i let her in on the real nature of my and emerson's beach escape."remember protection," she texts me, "and call immediately after this is not a drill.""i promise to call you the second i get off," i reply, "maybe even during, if you're lucky.""do not play with my emotions, lady," riley warns me.though i'm more than excited for the night to finally arrive, i do feel a slight nervousness starting to trip me up.i haven't really been with a guy since what happened with tucker all those years ago.even though my memories of that night with him are hazy, i start to worry about flashbacks, or even just bad vibes.obviously, emerson is nothing like tucker, and tonight will be nothing like the night of my assault.but still, i can't help but be a tiny bit anxious.tonight's dinner is even more delectable than the last.emerson takes me to a little italian place in town with the best pesto i've tasted... maybe ever.after we've polished off the last bites of birthday tiramisu, it's time at last to head back to our room.as if sensing the hush of anticipation, emerson cranks up the tunes on the way to the motel.the postal service serenades us all the way back, and i hurry to throw on some iron and wine from my laptop the second we're back in the room.awkward silences aren't so terrible when sam beam croons over them, it turns out.emerson and i both shuck off our outer layers, and he moves to open up a second bottle of champagne."thanks," i tell him, accepting a cup of champagne and taking a generous swig."just let me freshen up a little, i'll be right out.""take your time," he tells me, his eyes lingering on his face.he can tell something is a little off, but is nice enough not to say anything outright.i duck into the bathroom, drinking down the rest of my champagne and studying myself in the mirror."you can do this," i whisper, coaching myself through my nerves, "you've wanted this for years.since before anything even happened with tucker.emerson is amazing, and he cares about you, and... and..." "everything ok in there?"emerson asks at the door."yep!"i reply, my voice an octave higher than it usually is, "totally fine!""abby," he says, in a voice that tells me he knows the truth, "do you want to talk?"sighing, i turn and gently pull open the bathroom door."come on in," i say, trying to play off my embarrassment as i turn and sit on the edge of the tub."so.what's going on up there?"he asks, glancing up at my head."tell me.""i'm just... it's..."i stammer, blushing as i try to string the words together."we've been talking about this all week.you know.the thing we decided to do today..." "oh, i know all about the thing," emerson smiles."and i still really want... the thing to happen," i stumble ahead, "but i'm sort of out of practice.i've only ever done this once before, and that wasn't such a great experience.and i know it won't always be like that, but you actually know what you're doing, and-" "hey, hey," emerson says, wrapping an arm around me."it's ok, abby.i understand completely.you don't have to keep anything from me, you know that.""i guess i do," i say quietly."look," emerson says, taking my face in his hand, "i'm crazy about you, abby.and i always will be.now, because this world is a shitty, unfair place, we don't have always.because tomorrow, our parents are swooping in to fuck everything up.we only have tonight.but i would rather miss out entirely on having you than force you into anything you don't want to do.ok?i want you to want this as much as i do.and if any part of you isn't interested, or is uncomfortable, then we don't have to do anything.just tell me what you want."i bring my hazel eyes to emerson's, amazed by his level-headedness.he'd pass up on having sex on the only night we actually can out of respect for me.i know, in this moment, that i can trust him.and to be honest, i think i knew that all along.i'm ready for this."what i want," i tell him, my voice dipping low once more, "is for you to kiss me now."he doesn't have to be told twice.emerson's lips brush against mine, softly at first.we warm to each other in an instant, leaving our cups of champagne by the wayside as our kiss becomes more earnest, more searching.i wrap my arms around his broad shoulders, digging my hands into his chestnut hair.he slips an arm around my waist, pulling me to him.emerson lifts me into his lap, cradling me against his hard chest as our tongues glide and glance against each other.the taste of him is more intoxicating than any champagne i've ever tasted."take me to the bed," i whisper, kissing down along his throat.i feel emerson slip an arm under my knees and effortlessly pick me up.he's a solid foot taller than me, and probably about 75 pounds heavier, so i might as well be a feather in his arms-or so he makes me feel.in a few quick strides, he's carried me out of the bathroom and over to the queen sized bed.just as i've imagined it a thousand times, he lays me out across the bedspread, drinking in the sight of me with his blue eyes.only this time, it's better than what i've imagined.because this time, it's real."undress me," i tell him, "i want you to."emerson kneels before me on the bed, his gaze burning with lust."that's right," he murmurs, his voice low and hoarse, "i love it when you tell me what you want."he lifts the black cotton tee shirt up over my head, and shucks off his own flannel.catching my wrists in his hands, he pins them up over my head and lowers his body on top of mine, kissing me from the neck to the space between my breasts.he flicks open the clasp of my bra and closes his teeth around the edge of one cup, glancing up at me with a devilish wink.i feel a deep throb of need between my legs as he tugs my bra away with his teeth, then pulls the white tank top up over his head and immediately lowers his full lips to my chest.i suck in a huge breath as he wraps his lips around my taut nipple, his hands roving down my torso all the while.the tip of his tongue flicks against the hard peak, sending a rush of sensation to the tips of my fingers and toes.my head falls back against the bed as he sucks on my breasts, and i'm so distracted that i almost don't notice as he eases the skinny jeans down off my legs."you wore them," he grins, sitting back on his heels to admire my choice in panties.i look down at the black lace thong barely covering my most intimate flesh.it's the same pair i was wearing that night at the party, when we finally let each other in on how we really felt, if not out loud.that night seems like eons ago, but it's only been a matter of weeks.look how much can change when you're honest about what you really want."i thought you'd appreciate that," i whisper, letting my legs fall open before him."appreciation doesn't even come close," he growls, unbuckling his belt and tugging down his own jeans.the rise in his black briefs can't be contained.he's hard as a rock for me, and absolutely huge.emerson loops his fingers through the band of my thong and slowly, reverently, eases it down my legs.i lay before him, utterly naked, the cool air playing against my slick sex.with his eyes locked on me, emerson tugs down his briefs, letting me see him in all his glory.for a moment, it's all we can do to stare at each other.emerson kneels over me, his cock standing at full attention for me.i drink in the sight of it, thick and throbbing with want.without thinking, i bring my hands to his hard length-i need both to grab hold of it.emerson groans as i kneel opposite him, working my hands all along his cock.taking my lead, he lays back on the bed as i continue to stroke him, feeling him get harder in my hands.as his head hits the pillow, i can't wait any longer.i bring my lips to the round, shapely tip of him and close my lips around it.his eyes scrunch up in bliss as i take his cock into my mouth, running my tongue along his tender shaft.i work my mouth along him, using both hands to keep a firm grasp.i love the feel of him as he fills up my mouth, the taste of him as he pulses for me."abby," he gasps, reaching for me, "i need you... i need..." "tell me," i breathe, breaking away before running my tongue all around his bulging head."tell me what you want."in reply, i feel his hands close around my hips and tug me up toward him.i let him guide me, not knowing where this is heading but not caring too much either.with firm hands, he turns my body around so that i'm facing away from him.before i can ask what he wants me to do, he's tugged my hips back toward his face, lying out beneath me.i cry out in delighted surprise as he brings his mouth swiftly to my sex, licking along my wet slit from below.my back arches with pleasure as the tip of his tongue finds my rock hard clit, and i groan as he wraps his lips around it.his cock is standing tall, harder than ever and far too delicious-looking to let be.as emerson flicks his tongue across my aching clit, i lean forward and take him into my mouth as voraciously as ever.we work each other into a frenzy, giving and taking as much as we can possibly manage.how can something feel so illicit and so natural all at the same time?i suck hard on emerson's cock as i feel myself teetering on the edge of orgasm.he must be able to feel it in me, because he takes out all the stops.i feel him slide two strong fingers into me as he licks along the length of me.his fingers pulse against that tender spot inside of me as the tip of his tongue flicks against my clit.and just like that, i'm a goner.i come hard as he laps up my desire, the room spinning around me.as the orgasm shudders through me, emerson rolls me onto my back.i sprawl out beneath him, wide-eyed with blissful wonder.wordlessly, he reaches into the pocket of his discarded jeans and pulls out a condom.ripping open the package with his teeth, he can scarcely keep his eyes off of me.he rolls the condom down his pulsating length, and it finally hits me : this is really happening.his eyes are blazing as he lowers his taut body to mine.wrapping my ankles around his tapered waist, i moan as i feel his swollen head pressing against my wet sex.this is it.at long last.emerson locks his eyes on mine, and we might as well be the only two people on the planet.he lingers there for just a moment, on the precipice of our knowing each other in an entirely new way.my whole body is screaming to feel him drive into me, demolish and rebuild me with the force of his need.i reach up and take his face in my hands."i'm all yours," i whisper, my gaze steady on his face."take me."something blazes behind his eyes as he brings his mouth to mine.he bucks his hips, pressing himself into me.a moan fills my throat as he parts my silky flesh with his staggering length.i can feel him diving into the very core of me.at last, he's all the way in, and i can scarcely believe that he fits at all.but he does.and it feels fucking fantastic.our bodies move together, limbs tangled, chests heaving.he drives into me as i pull him in further, each of us trying to feel as much of the other as possible.a low, thudding bliss is building inside of me once more, and i can feel him growing to fill me-he's right on the edge.he thrusts hard and deep, his face screwed up in a mask of ecstatic wonder.i grab hold of his perfect, firm ass, pulling him in as far as i can as i tell him, "let go."both of our voices swell into a huge groan as he pummels into me once more and comes, hard.i clutch onto him as i feel him spasm and gush inside of me, gaze up at him as his mouth falls open into a perfect "o".it feels like a year goes by before we even begin to come back down to earth again.emerson lowers himself down next to me on the bed, pulling me to his chest.i rest my cheek on his hot skin, listening to the wild beating of his heart.i can't formulate a single word to tell him what this has meant to me, that it was so much better than i ever could have hoped, and that i don't know how i'll stand to never have him again.but the thing is, i don't need to tell him.just laying here beside me, it's clear that he already knows.chapter nine i arrange my blonde hair into a hasty up-do, trying to keep from crying.i've been on the verge of tears since about five minutes after i woke up this morning-when i remembered what today is.our parents' wedding day.the day that emerson and i become step siblings.i've changed into my maid of honor dress, a lavender sheath, and tried my best to apply fancy makeup.we have to head right to the church this morning, just like we promised, and we're already getting kind of a late start.i lock eyes with myself in the mirror, see the tears shining there."stop it," i whisper, "you can't cry now.you always knew this was coming."but even though emerson and i had our one night together knowing full well that it would be our last, it doesn't make it hurt any less.stepping out into the hotel bedroom, i feel my heart clench painfully as emerson turns to face me across the space.he's wearing a simple gray suit, but it might as well be a tux for how good it looks on him.his hair is pushed away from his face, though the signature stubble i love so much is still in place.his blue eyes are shining with remorse for what's about to happen and elation at what passed between us last night."you look beautiful," he says, his voice ragged with conflicting emotion."thank you," i say softly, "you look amazing, too.""here," he says, moving to the motel mini-fridge.he opens it up and takes out a corsage in its little container.it's a small sprig of lilac tied with an ivory ribbon."what is this, prom?"i laugh tearfully, as emerson eases the band of the corsage up over my wrist."just as miserable as prom, probably," he grins wistfully, lacing my fingers through his."well, don't go overboard," i joke, stepping toward him.without preamble, he pulls me into a tight embrace, pressing his lips ardently to mine.i take his face in my hands, kissing him hard.we both know that this is the last kiss we'll ever share.it's closed-lipped, almost sacred.and i'll never forget it."i don't know how just yet," emerson murmurs, running his hands down my arms, "but it's going to be ok, abby.we're gon na make it through this.""i'll have to take your word for it," i say, shaking my head, "because right now, i can't see how i'm ever going to feel alright again.""at least we'll still be in each others' lives," emerson says, searching for a silver lining."even if it won't be... how we'd prefer.""i hope you know that i'll never stop wondering what might have happened between us," i whisper, "you know.if only..." "i know," he says softly, kissing me on the forehead, "me too, abby."knowing that we won't be able to utter another word without breaking into tears, we silently gather our things.we stand in the threshold together, looking back at the motel room.i'm not sure that i'll ever be as happy again as i have been here.as emerson closes the door behind us, it feels like something is being entombed here-some part of me that is lost forever.i sink into the passenger seat of the chevy and stare out the window as we set off on the long drive back to our home town.hopefully, by the time we get there, i'll find it in my heart to fake a smile or two for my father's wedding day.things are already well underway at our home by the time we pull up.my dad is waiting on the front steps, looking tense.i recognize my grandparents' car, and another that must belong to the justice of the peace, in the driveway."there you two are!"my dad cries, beckoning us forward."come in, come in.frank and gillian are waiting to see you."that's why he looks tense.he and my grandparents are already sure to be butting heads.i give dad a quick kiss on the cheek as i pass."you look nice, daddy," i tell him, trying to be chipper."you too, sweetie," he replies distractedly.a pang of sadness twists my core at our clipped address.he's taking so much away from me today, more than he could ever know, and for what?a shadow of the relationship we used to have?i force myself not to think of it as i hurry toward the kitchen with emerson in tow.stepping inside, i spot my grandparents huddled over the counter.they're dressed to the nines-grandpa frank in an italian wool suit, grandma jillian in her favorite fur stole.they've always looked to me like first class passengers on some old-timey luxury cruise line.the only things unappealing about their appearances today are the twin scowls they try to cover up as i approach."abigail," grandma jillian smiles, air-kissing both of my cheeks.a soft wash of her signature chanel perfume brings back a million memories of tense family gatherings and etiquette lessons.i love my grandparents, but there's definitely a lot of pressure that goes along with trying to meet their expectations."you look gorgeous, dear," grandpa frank says, giving me a swift kiss on the hand.they're a beautiful couple, and look much younger than they actually are.grandma's perfect crown of platinum blonde curls, grandpa's swoosh of silver hair, and their bright white smiles make them look like an advertisement for the swankiest retirement community around."grandpa, grandma, this is emerson-deb's son," i say, glancing emerson's way.he's got both hands shoved into his pockets, and his mouth is a hard, solemn line."ah," grandpa says, without warmth."well.hello, emerson.""hey," emerson nods."i'm jillian.it's nice to meet you," grandma says, offering her hand for emerson to kiss.i watch, trying not to laugh, as he takes her hand and gives it a good solid shake instead."and here's the man of the hour himself," grandpa says, looking up as dad walks into the kitchen with the justice of the peace-a balding man with a cheerful red face."are we starting soon?"grandma asks, "the girls are playing bridge at three and i'd really prefer not to be late.""we'll start as soon as deb is ready," dad replies curtly."i'm sure she's just putting the finishing touches on-" "i'm all set!"deb sings out from the stairs.we all turn to watch her grand entrance as she clatters down the last few steps and struts her stuff our way.i can practically hear my grandparents' jaws crack against the tile floor as deb meets us in the kitchen.her rhinestone-encrusted heels must be five inches high, and fully visible beneath the micro minidress that's serving as her wedding gown.a huge, flowing bustle trails along behind her, and her already voluminous blonde curls are stacked a mile high in a hairdo that would make the most seasoned pageant girl raise an eyebrow.her makeup looks painted on, most especially her hot pink lipstick.she looks positively ecstatic... but not exactly the picture of the blushing bride we all had in mind-especially my grandparents."i can't believe our wedding day is finally here!"she squeals, leaping into my dad's arms.she kisses every inch of his face, leaving little smudges of pink all over.i'm a little concerned that my grandparents have literally turned to stone beside me.dad manages to pry deb off of him long enough to turn her frank and jillian's way."deb," my dad says through a forced smile, "these are my parents.""oh.my.god," deb breathes, splaying her hands out over her heart."you are just about the fanciest people i've ever seen in my entire life.""yes.well," grandma says, unable to form any additional words."that is... some dress you've got there," grandpa attempts."dad," my own father hisses warningly."oh, you like it?"deb chirps, giving us all a little spin."i got in at forty percent off.still a rip off, if you ask me, but heck-it's a special occasion, right?and it's not like bob here is hurting for money."my grandparents' eyebrows shoot up, disappearing into their hair lines.deb falters, looking back and forth between them."i'm sorry.was that tacky?""ah, so you are familiar with the word, then," grandma says coolly.i glance at emerson, embarrassed by my grandparents' icy behavior.but his face is totally unreadable-i have no idea if he's even listening.deb, not knowing what to do with my grandparents' disdain, turns to emerson and me with a tight grin."now you two look so darling," she sighs tearfully."our big happy family, at last."i catch grandpa rolling his eyes as the justice of the peace claps his hands."so!"the jolly official says, "shall we head to the backyard for the ceremony?"deb grabs hold of my dad's hand and yanks him out the back door.they've set up a flimsy white altar in front of the pool, which is filled with floating flower blossoms.emerson walks out ahead of me, keeping his eyes straight ahead, and my grandparents bring up the rear.deb's heels sink into the grass as she teeters toward the altar on my dad's arm.emerson stands beside her, and i take my place next to dad.the justice of the peace stands between them, and my grandparents move front and center, all but wrinkling their noses.the wedding of the century, indeed.i can't make myself focus as the justice of the peace starts rattling through the motions.emerson and i stand facing each other, looking over our parents' shoulders.i've never seen him look so miserable.more than being upset for my own heartbreak, i hate our parents in this moment for causing emerson so much pain.he's been through so much already, and now this fiasco?it's more than anyone should have to bear."ok then," the justice of the peace goes on."if we could have the rings..." emerson thrusts them into my dad's hand.our parents slip the gaudy trinkets onto each other's hands, grinning like two teenagers.the words of their vows and even their "i do's" fade into white noise as emerson finally lifts his eyes to mine.we stare at each other, laid bare in this anguished moment.our gazes say what we never got a chance to : "i care about you more than anything in this world.i'm so sorry you're in pain."and as our parents share their first kiss as man and wife, i try my best to tell emerson one more thing with my silent, pleading eyes : "i love you."and as i look on, my heart breaking, i could swear his blue eyes tell me, "i love you too."chapter ten by midnight the house is all but silent once more.leftover food and cake clutters every surface of the kitchen, crushed petals stain the floors, and the plastic flowers on the rickety altar out back have started dropping off, one by one.dad and deb have flown the coop, off on the first leg of their honeymoon in new york city.grandma and grandpa beat a quick retreat after a bite of cake and three brandies each.the house, my home, feels like a crypt now.but i suppose that's appropriate-i'm certainly in mourning.emerson and i, still dressed up in our wedding day best, sit side-by-side at the kitchen island.there's an open bottle of vodka and a gigantic round of wedding cake sitting between us, and we're helping ourselves to an abundance of both.neither of us can think of anything productive to say, but are loathe to be alone tonight.we sit there in silence, being careful not to brush elbows or even look at each other for too long.as of this afternoon, when the ink dried on our parents' marriage license, our relationship can only be strictly platonic.i haven't been this miserable since my mom passed away.this feeling of running up against devastating injustice is something i'm all too familiar with by now.without a word, emerson refills our glasses of straight vodka.he snatches up his glass and downs his booze in one swallow.tearing off his necktie, he staggers to his feet.i stare at him as he turns to leave."where are you going?"i murmur, the room spinning as i stand up after him."bed," he growls, not looking at me."that's it?"i ask around the sudden lump in my throat, "it's just gon na be one word answers from now on?""what did you expect?"he replies, keeping his back to me."i expected you to... to be..." "your friend?"he scoffs, shoving a hand through his hair."that was never going to happen, abby.you know that as well as i do.""we have to at least try," i say softly, reaching out to touch him.at the slightest brush of my fingers, he rips his arm away from me, spinning around with fire in his eyes."i can't do that," he rages."no fucking way can i just be your friend.""don't yell at me," i say, steadying myself against the counter."you're drunk.you're upset.this isn't you talking-" "as if you know the first thing about me," he fires back, shaking his head."one fuck, and you think we're soul mates or something?""stop it," i tell him fiercely."i know what you're doing.you're trying to hurt me.trying to drive me away so that you don't have to deal with what's happening.well too fucking bad.i'm not going anywhere, emerson.you can't scare me away.""no?"he demands, stepping toward me.he plants one hand on either side of me, caging me in against the counter."you really think so?""yes.i do," i whisper, keeping my hazel eyes trained on his face.our lips are mere inches from each other, our bodies all but pressed together.the sudden proximity of him sets me to trembling.i can't be strong enough for both of us.i need his help."please, emerson," i say, blinking away the tears that blur my vision."could you just... hold me?just for a second."he stares at me, his blue eyes frozen over.but as the first tear rolls down my cheek, i watch the ice crack.the fight goes out of him, making way for the despair he's been trying to cover up with aggression."come here," he murmurs, opening his arms to me.i rush to him, throwing myself into his embrace.he enfolds me in a fierce hug as the tears come hard and fast.he kisses the top of my head, pulling me tightly against him."you can't disappear on me like that," i cry, burying my face in the front of his suit."i can't get through this without you, emerson.""i know.i'm sorry," he says, his voice rasping."this is just... it's so hard, abby.what am i supposed to do without you in my life?the way i want you to be, i mean...?""i'll let you know when i figure it out," i say miserably.we hold each other, each unwilling to be the first to break the embrace.as the sky begins to lighten, we finally trudge upstairs, entirely spent.i walk ahead of emerson, my body tired and aching.the prospect of sleeping alone tonight is too much to bear.it's hard to believe that it was just last night that i fell asleep next to emerson, my cheek resting against his bare chest.it feels like years ago that our bodies met, collided, moved as one.it was, without question, the best night of my life.and would you look at that?it's being followed up by the worst.emerson and i reach the top of the stairs and pause, each glancing at our bedrooms at opposite ends of the hall.turning away from each other now seems like the final step, the last nail in the coffin sealing up our barely-formed relationship.after the wrenching, brutal escapade that was our parents' wedding ceremony this afternoon, i don't know if i can take it."you know," i say softly."today was sort of like a nightmare.""that's for fucking sure," he murmurs, glancing my way."and after a nightmare... isn't is usually ok for a little sister to crawl into her big brother's bed?"i ask tearfully.a slow, sad smile spreads across his gorgeous face."nice justification, weirdo," he teases softly, offering me his hand.i lace my fingers through his.silently, we walk down the hallway toward his room.we don't even have the energy to change out of our clothes.with vodka-clouded heads and heavy hearts, we collapse onto his bed.emerson wraps his arms around me, pulling me close.there's no question of things going any further between us now, but this simple comforting embrace is a balm for my battered soul.in an instant we've fallen into a deep, mercifully dreamless sleep.i'm jerked out of slumber the next morning by the sound of screaming voices.prying open my eyes, i notice two things straightaway.first, i am massively hungover, having eaten next to nothing yesterday and had half a bottle of vodka to drink.second, i'm still lying beside the sleeping emerson, despite the fact that it's monday morning and school is set to start in a mere twenty minutes.but before i can worry about my attendance record, the crash of shattering glass catches my ear from downstairs.two hysterical voices rage at each other as other objects go hurtling around the ground floor.emerson's eyes fly open at the sound of the unfolding chaos, and we turn to look at each other, at a loss.i recognize dad and deb's voices at once, but i've never heard either of them so irate."funneling my money to that lowlife junkie!"my dad bellows, as something heavy topples over."your money?"deb cries shrilly, "you mean your parents' money, don't you?""don't start with that class warfare bullshit-" "i don't have to!they already did.you think i didn't see how they looked at me yesterday?you'd think i was wearing a g-string and pasties-" "well, you weren't wearing much else!"something else smashes into a thousand pieces, and i grab for emerson's hand, panicked."don't try and change the goddamn subject," my dad snarls."you've been stealing from me for your scumbag ex and your loser drug baby!"emerson's fingers tighten around mine, his body rippling with fury."my son is not a loser!"deb weeps, charging up the stairs, "and he's not staying here in this house for another second!"the entire world grinds to a standstill as emerson's bedroom door flies open.deb appears in the doorway, thick rivulets of mascara coursing down her cheeks.emerson and i stare up at her, entwined in his bed, as my red-faced father appears on the top of the stairs.the four of us are frozen in a surreal tableau, and for a second i hope against all hope that this is just another terrible dream but in the next moment, reality floods back in."what the fuck is this?"deb shrieks, falling back against the door in horror."we were just-we-" i stammer, looking helplessly at emerson."get away of my daughter, you piece of shit!"my dad roars, charging into the bedroom.he grabs me by my arm and wrenches me brutally out of bed."dad, you're hurting me," i gasp, trying and failing to break free from his grip."don't touch her," emerson shouts, leaping to his feet and shoving my father away from me.he shields me from my dad's wrath with his solid body, but my dad lunges for me all the same.the smell of booze seeping off of him turns my stomach."are you drunk?"i gasp, staring at my father.but his swaying stance and bloodshot eyes answer my question.i whip around toward deb and see that she, too, is standing unsteadily, unable to focus on a single point for more than a second.it's not even nine o'clock, and they're both wasted."jesus christ, mom," emerson growls, staring at his mother in disbelief."again?""don't you judge me," deb snaps, shaking her mess of wilted curls."if you knew the sort of night i had... this man is a monster.""i'm a monster?"my dad returns, whirling unsteadily toward her, "you're the lying, thieving whore-" "emerson, no!"i screech, as he cocks back his fist and slams it against my father's jaw.dad goes reeling through the open doorway, and emerson leaps after him.deb collapses into a teary puddle as emerson and dad brawl on the landing.i rush toward them, ready to throw myself into the fray.but a loose punch from dad hits me square in the stomach, knocking me back against the wall.emerson snaps his face toward me, too worried about my wellbeing to focus on my dad.but in the moment of his distraction, dad strikes back-sending a cracking blow railing against emerson's high cheekbone.a sickening crunch rings out through the house.a scream rips out of my throat as emerson stumbles against the second story railing.my dad tries to grab him by the front of his suit, but misses.in a burst of rage, emerson grabs hold of my dad and slams him against the bannister, ready to throw him off the landing."stop it!emerson, stop!"i scream.finally, i seem to get through to him.with gritted teeth, he lowers my dad away from the edge, tossing him roughly onto the floor.he raises his blue eyes to mine, and my heart shatters as i see the furious tears streaming down his face.stepping over my dad's drunken, prostrate form, emerson marches into his room and snatches his mother up by the arm.she can barely stand, beside herself with wasted emotion.emerson swings her arm over his shoulders and all but drags her away, carrying her dead weight down the stairs."wait," i call out, my voice a strangled cry, "emerson, where are you going?"but he doesn't answer me.he simply makes his way to the front door.i pull myself off the ground and race after him, grabbing for the back of his suit."emerson," i plead, clutching the bannister as i reach the final stair."stop.you can't go.not now."he pauses with his hand on the doorknob.turning back to look at me, his eyes are full of hardened resolve.he's shut his heart out of the equation, i know.and try as i might, there will be no reaching him now."goodbye abby," he whispers, and wrenches the door open.he guides his mother across the threshold and out to his chevy.it isn't until i hear the engine start that i sink down onto the stairs, hollow and cold.he's gone.and this time, i know he won't be coming back for me.i glance around the house, at all the artifacts of my childhood that were destroyed in dad and deb's wake.but of course, it's not the material things i grieve for, now.it's my entire life as i've known it.the future that will never come to pass.i sit there at the foot of the steps for hours, listening to my dad's anguished groans from the landing.at some point, he manages to stand and pull himself into the master bedroom, slamming the door behind him.he won't come down to check on me.not in the state he's in.but who am i kidding?even at his best, dad couldn't be bothered to give a shit about me.numbness creeps through my body as i sit stock still, unable to process what's happened to me.to emerson.to our splintered family.nothing that's happened this morning makes any sense.what happened that set our parents to drinking like that?what was my dad saying about deb stealing from him?and what about my grandparents' interference with dad and deb's brand new marriage?chapter eleven it's noon before i'm torn out of my shocked reverie by the sound of a car door slamming.my pulse picks up as i pull myself to my feet.has emerson come back home again after all?is he here to help me make sense of all this chaos?the front door clatters open, and a familiar face appears-but it isn't his."abby," riley breathes, rushing to me."abby, what the hell is going on?""riley?"i breathe, unable to focus, "riley, what-?""are you ok?"she whispers, her voice tearful.she takes me in her arms, brushing the hair out of my eyes."are you hurt?""no, i'm... riley, what are you doing here?"i ask."how did you know to come?"her already dark eyes cloud over as she wraps her arms around me.she's bracing me for something.bad news.but what?"you didn't show up at school," she says softly, "but emerson did.he stormed in just as people were switching classes.abby... he...""what?"i whisper, looking at her with mounting dread."what did he do?"she rests her hands on my shoulders, take a deep breath, and goes on."he started screaming for tucker," she tells me, "and when he finally found him, he... abby, he just beat the shit out of him.it was brutal.some teachers eventually pulled him off and threatened to call the cops.emerson's been expelled, abby.he ran back out of the school and drove off.i couldn't find you anywhere, so i thought... i was so scared..." i stare at my best friend, uncomprehending.my heart can take on no more anguish.there isn't any room left.i sink into a state of catatonic silence as riley gathers a change of clothes for me and leads me out of my house.it's the last time i ever step foot in that place i once called home.over the course of the tumultuous next few months, the entire sordid saga comes out into the open.on the morning after their wedding, dad and deb were about to head off to europe for a couple weeks for the second leg of their honeymoon.dad visited the bank to get some travelers' checks, but found that his accounts had been frozen because of some suspicious activity.he and deb had already consolidated accounts when they moved in together, but dad has never been good about keeping track of his money.only when it was pointed out to him by the bank did he notice the dozen or so transactions in deb's name.she'd been withdrawing money, keeping some in a separate account, presumably for her and emerson.the rest she'd been wiring to her ex-husband, emerson's father, still serving time in connecticut state prison.devastated by deb's betrayal, dad struck out to hurt her in the worst way he could think of.he stocked up on booze, headed back to the hotel, and baited her into going on a bender with him.she allowed it to happen, of course, but dad was the instigator.only when they were both wasted in their hotel room in the wee hours of the morning did he turn on her.he demanded an explanation, but the only one she had to give was that she'd been using him.she noticed him at aa-saw his nice clothes, fancy car, and sad eyes-and knew he'd go for her.deb insisted that she developed real feelings for him later, and that she couldn't just leave her ex-husband to rot in prison, but it was obviously too late.emerson's expulsion from our high school was immediate and ironclad, after what he did to tucker.i have no idea what possessed him, in that moment, to target my assailant from years ago.maybe he wanted to hurt someone who had hurt me, and given that he couldn't throttle my dad the way he wanted to, went after tucker instead.i'll never know what his motivation was.all i know is that tucker ended up with two broken ribs and had to wear a neck brace to prom.or so i'm told.it's not like i had any reason to go.the bender dad started as payback for deb didn't end the day after his wedding.or the week after.or the month after.he descended into an alcoholic depression that far exceeded the one he'd fallen into after mom's death.i couldn't go back to his house-i didn't feel safe there.i stayed with riley for a few days before my grandparents arrived on the scene.they came up from florida and took me in to one of their nearby summer homes for the duration of the school year.dad didn't even put up a fight when they took me away.but he did tell them all about finding me in bed with emerson the morning after the wedding.and even though nothing had happened between us that night, my grandparents looked at me a little differently from then on.in no time at all, the marriage was annulled.no one will tell me where emerson and deb have gone, and i don't even know where to start looking.but to be honest, i'm too brokenhearted to search very hard.if emerson wanted me to know where he was, i'd know.as painful as it is, i have to accept the fact that he doesn't want to be a part of my life.even once our parents' marriage is dissolved, there's no trace of him.so be it.i dive into the last semester of my schoolwork, and end up graduating in the top ten percent of my class.riley and i both decide to continue our studies in the fall at the new school in new york city.my grandparents agree to pay for the portion of my tuition that isn't covered by scholarships, and even let riley and me stay in the apartment they own in new york as an investment property.i spend the summer by my best friend's side, slowly but surely coming to terms with everything that's happened.i tell myself every day that come fall, i'll be able to leave the whole ugly mess of my childhood behind me.and hopefully, my memories of emerson sawyer along with it.chapter twelve new york city eight years later "which do you like better?"i ask anxiously, holding two dresses up before me, "the black, or the navy?"riley rolls her eyes at my outfit choices."i'd like it if you ever bought anything that you couldn't also wear to a funeral," she replies."would you be serious?"i plead, "my interview is in two hours, and god knows it's probably going to take me an hour to get there, and i might have to stop and find a starbucks to pee in first because i can't ask to pee during an interview-" "abby," riley says, taking my just-scrubbed face in her hands."relax.you're going to nail this.you are perfect for this job."i stare back at her, trying to have as much confidence in me as she does.in the past six years, riley has transformed from a dissatisfied party girl to a successful pr powerhouse.she's traded in the cheap vodka for top-shelf martinis and the house parties for bottle service and chef's tables at all the best places in the city.we've been living together since we were eighteen, and are closer than ever because of it.but being close means being blunt, and she doesn't hold back with me now."if you don't take a breath and cool it, you're going to be kicking yourself all the way home," she says, marching me over to her closet.she rummages through her colorful wardrobe and hands me an emerald green blouse and yellow pencil skirt."here.put these on.""they're very... bright," i say."just like you!"she grins."you're interviewing at a creative agency, not a morgue, for christ's sake.a little color will be good, trust me.""well.thanks," i sigh, taking the pieces and heading back into my room to change."i won't fill them out as well as you, but..." "if you think i'm going to cry you a river for having stayed the same size since you were seventeen years old, you've got another thing coming to you," riley tells me."speaking of getting older, though, what do you want to do for your birthday this weekend?""nothing," i tell her through the crack in my bedroom door."that's not an option," she replies, as i slip into the clothes she's leant me."you know i hate my birthday," i call back, piling my hair into a quick, wispy up do.it's still blonde, if a bit of a darker shade than when i was a kid."all i ever want is to have a quiet night at home.""and you know that i've never taken that for an answer," riley reminds me, rustling around the kitchen."my grandparents are already taking me out to some swanky restaurant," i tell her, "i owe it to them for letting us stay in this place.""they're not using it," riley reminds me."still," i insist, "living rent free is not exactly something to be taken for granted.""not with what i spend on booze it isn't," riley agrees."at least let me take you out for a drink after your fancy dinner, ok?you can give me all the juicy family gossip."i cringe to think of what that gossip might be as i swipe some light makeup onto my face.every time i see my grandparents, they spend at least an hour moaning about how badly my dad is doing.he's been in and out of rehab since breaking up with "that woman," as my grandparents like to refer deb.after the brawl that ensued the morning after his wedding, i no longer make an effort to include him in my life.some things can't be forgiven, and the way he treated me that day is one of them."i'll give you one birthday drink," i tell riley, grabbing my purse, "but no surprise karaoke this year, ok?or surprise strippers.or... you know what?just no surprises period.""cross my heart," riley smiles."sure," i say, stepping back out into the living room."so?how do i look?""fabulous, as ever," she says, giving me a quick once-over."they're going to love you.""i hope so," i sigh, "bastian does such amazing work.they're one of the best new creative agencies out there.it would be a dream to work for them.""so, tell them that!"riley insists, giving me a quick hug and a pat on the ass."go get'em tiger."i take a deep breath and march out of our upper west side apartment.it's been a few months since i finished my masters program in graphic design.i've been able to freelance for a few different companies, and have built up my portfolio by doing so.i never pictured myself having such a tech-based job, always sort of assumed i'd stick with visual art exclusively.but graphic design lets me be just as creative as drawing does, and employ my mind in other ways, too.if i get this job as bastian, i'll be designing and helping come up with marketing strategies for different companies and brands.it would be something new every day, the perfect, totally consuming job.just what i'm looking for.don't get me wrong, i have other interests and hobbies, outside of work.i'm an avid runner, adore going out to restaurants, read like a maniac, and try and volunteer around the city.i just loathe downtime more than anything in the world.downtime means thinking time, reminiscing time, and i want as little of that in my life as possible.without fail, my thoughts always turn to the past if they're not rooted in the present.and that's never a pleasant experience for me.i take the subway down to the lower east side, a neighborhood chock full of galleries, cool shops, and excellent cafes-not the mention some kickass bars.the bastian offices are housed in a building that used to be a factory, once upon a time.these days, it has the industrial feel that's so popular in the city while simultaneously being super high tech.the best of both worlds.i stop before the front door the office, taking a moment to check my reflection in the glass.riley was right to suggest this top-it brings out the green in my hazel eyes nicely.as i ring the buzzer, a strange feeling passes through me.it's almost like deja vu, the feeling that this moment is significant, somehow.clandestine.maybe i'm just anticipating the interview going well?whatever the case, there's no more time to ponder.the door opens before me, and i step quickly into an old fashioned elevator.the elevator doors part before me, and i step out into the high-ceilinged office space.a large communal desk stands at the center of the room, surrounded by a dozen hip twenty-somethings.the walls are covered in white board, so that people can jot down ideas whenever and wherever they occur.my jaw falls open a little as i see a fully stocked bar standing in one corner of the main room.the people running this place weren't kidding when they described it as "off beat".i like it.i'm supposed to be meeting with the founding partner and ceo of the agency, owen cooper.but glancing around the spacious room, i don't see a reception desk anywhere.silly me.as if a place this cool would ever have something as square as a front desk."are you abby?"asks one of the people at the communal desk, plucking out an earbud as the rest of the group types on."yeah, that's me," i smile, hoping my nervousness doesn't show."cooper is waiting for you in his office," she says, nodding toward a glass door off the main room.calling the boss by his last name, huh?how unconventional.another check in the plus column for this place.i thank her and make my way toward the door.before i can raise my hand to rap against the frosted glass pane, it swings open before me.standing there is a man i recognize from the bastian website as owen cooper himself.he's super young for a ceo, in his late 30's or so.he's dressed in jeans, a sweater, and a friendly smile."abby!"he says, as if we were old friends.i guess being able to check out interviewees' social media profiles makes everyone fast friends these days."come on in.coffee?""sure," i reply, "it's nice to meet you mr.-" "just'cooper' is fine," he cuts me off, pulling a shot from a fancy espresso machine sitting on a table against the wall."so, thanks for coming in.even if this is a bit of a formality.""what's that?"i ask, happily accepting the rich cup of espresso."your portfolio is excellent," he tells me, sitting down at his desk."top notch.i knew i wanted to hire you from the second i saw your work.sorry... did i forget to mention that in my last email to you?""that you did," i say, sinking into a chair opposite him in mild disbelief."are you saying... i already have the job?""you do if you want it!"he smiles, "you'll have to forgive
